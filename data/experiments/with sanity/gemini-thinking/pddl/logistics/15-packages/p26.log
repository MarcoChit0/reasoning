You are a highly-skilled professor in AI planning. Your task is to generate a plan for a PDDL instance from the domain <domain>logistics</domain>. You will be given the PDDL domain file and the PDDL instance file, and you need to return the plan between the tags <plan> and </plan>. You will receive two examples to help you in generating the plan.
