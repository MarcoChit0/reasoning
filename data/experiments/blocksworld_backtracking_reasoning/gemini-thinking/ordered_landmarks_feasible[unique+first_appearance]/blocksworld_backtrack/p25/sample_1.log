**Reflections on Planning for blocksworld_backtrack**

Okay, so I've been given a complex blocksworld problem with a specific requirement: I need to generate a plan that gets from an initial state to a goal state while respecting the order of provided action landmarks. These landmarks are crucial, they're like waypoints I have to hit along the path to the solution. My expert intuition suggests that the order of landmarks, coming from a delete relaxation analysis, might not give the *most efficient* plan, but it will work. I just have to be careful with the details of the actions: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, `unstack`.

The initial state is a bit of a mess â€“ a bunch of blocks are stacked in various configurations. The goal, fortunately, is well-defined: I need to create several specific stacks. I see something interesting: some of the goal stacks are *already* present in the initial state! That's a good thing, those stacks shouldn't be touched unless absolutely necessary (which the expert in me tells me may not be the case in a relaxed plan.)

I start by systematically analyzing each landmark. For each landmark action, I check its preconditions. If they're met, I apply the action and update the state. If they aren't, I have to figure out *how* to make them true, which means inserting the right "helper" actions like `putdown` and `unstack`.

The main challenge is handling the dependencies between actions. If one landmark requires a block to be clear, and that block is currently supporting another, I have to *unstack* that other block temporarily (usually on the table) before returning to the landmarks. It gets a little more complex when these re-stacking operations are made temporary, only to re-unstacked to achieve another part of the landmark sequence.

I realize that this approach might result in some seemingly unnecessary actions. For example, if I have to `unstack b2 b20` to satisfy a landmark, and `(on b2 b20)` *is* already true, I must put `b2` down on the table (since it's held), and *then* re-stack it to establish the condition. I understand this comes from delete relaxation's perspective. It still is a valid plan, though.

By carefully considering each step, managing preconditions, and inserting helper actions, I managed to create a valid plan that respects the order of the landmarks and achieves the goal. While it might not be the *shortest* plan, it demonstrates how to solve a blocksworld problem under these specific landmark constraints. The landmarks order often causes the planning path to move blocks around until each landmark is achieved.
