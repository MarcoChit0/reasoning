**My Process for Generating a Blocksworld Plan with Landmark Constraints**

Okay, here's my approach to solving this blocksworld planning problem. I'm given a domain description, an initial state, a goal state, and a set of landmark actions that must appear in the plan's order.  My goal is to create a valid plan that respects this landmark order and, of course, achieves the desired goal state.

First, I deeply *understand the problem* and the actions: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`. I'm very familiar with the preconditions and effects of each action in the `blocksworld-4ops` domain.

Then, I *analyze* the initial state and the goal state to get a solid grasp of the starting and ending conditions.  I pay close attention to which blocks are initially clear and how they're stacked.

The heart of my solution is *processing the landmarks in sequence*.  For each landmark, I meticulously check its preconditions against the current state. If a landmark's preconditions are *not* met, I add the necessary actions to *make* them true. This often involves actions that seem unrelated to the landmark itself (like moving blocks to clear the path). This is where the "backtracking" element comes into play.

I maintain a *current state* representation, and after applying any action, I immediately update the state. I also use *intermediate actions* such as `putdown` to put the blocks which do not belong to their final positions, and I also *validate that all goal conditions* for each stack are true. I will execute the needed stack to make sure the state is correct, and I will fix goal conflicts when the are broken by the plan's structure.

The challenge is to handle dependencies. For instance, if a goal requires `b4 on b1` and another requires `b1 on b3`, but I have a landmark `(pickup b1)`, I *temporarily* unstack  `b4` from `b1` to meet the landmark condition. After completing the `(pickup b1)`, I must then re-stack `b4` on `b1` to achieve the goal condition. I ensure goal conditions are re-established after landmark fulfillment.

I carefully *trace each landmark*, adding intermediate actions whenever a precondition is not immediately satisfied and carefully *restoring goal conditions* that are broken in the process. I have to manage "backtracking" - sometimes it's necessary to temporarily break an earlier goal condition to satisfy a landmark, and then re-establish it later.

The plan I generate should achieve the goal state *and* include the landmarks in the prescribed order, and I am very familiar with the challenges of these types of constraint.
