**Blocksworld Planning: A Landmark-Guided Approach**

Alright, let's craft a plan for this blocksworld problem, adhering to the provided action landmarks while ensuring a final configuration where blocks are stacked as defined. I've got the domain and instance files, plus a feasible landmark order. My main task is to produce a valid PDDL plan that considers the landmarks' order of their initial appearance.

Here's my thought process. Initially, I identify the goal: achieving specific "on" relationships for numerous blocks. I then analyze the starting state: currently, the arm is empty, and blocks are stacked on each other or the table. The landmark order guides my planning, aiming to apply them respecting their first occurrence in the search.

I'm systematically processing each landmark. I start with the first one, for example `(unstack b1 b3)`. This means I check its preconditions, such as `(on b1 b3)`, `(clear b1)`, and `(arm-empty)`. If all preconditions are met in the current state, I add the action to the plan and update the state. For some landmarks, `stack` for example, I use the initial states to check for the needed `clear` attributes, otherwise I rely on the intermediate steps to fulfill those requirements.

Intermediate actions like `(putdown)` are incorporated when necessary. If the arm is holding a block and a landmark requires an empty arm, I put the held block on the table, fulfilling the current conditions. I put the blocks where it doesn't affect the goal state negatively. Intermediate `(pickup)` actions are inserted if a block must be picked up.

My plan creation follows a pattern of: landmark application, state update, and, if required, addition of intermediate actions. I'm carefully considering block dependencies. If a block to be stacked is currently supporting another block, I first unstack to be able to use the intended stack landmark.

I encountered a critical issue. My initial assumption was that any "undo" actions required by landmark order (like unstacking blocks) could simply be re-applied at the end. I later learned this assumption isn't true. During the process, the states changed, and "clear" conditions are also changing. To ensure the final goal state, some re-stacking is needed. After applying all the main landmarks, I have several goals that are unfulfilled. This means my strategy has to be slightly adjusted. To manage this re-stacking, I add a final sequence of actions, ensuring that I re-stack some blocks on their original locations, or other goal positions to fulfill all the target "on" relationships.

I have assembled the complete plan: a sequence of `unstack`, `putdown`, `pickup`, and `stack` actions that correctly follow the landmark order and achieves the required final state.
