This PDDL instance defines a goal state that is unsatisfiable given the standard semantics of the Blocksworld domain.

Specifically, the goal state contains the following predicates related to block `b11`:
*   `(on b23 b11)`: This means block `b23` must be directly on top of `b11`.
*   `(on b17 b11)`: This means block `b17` must also be directly on top of `b11`.

In the Blocksworld domain, a block can only have one other block directly on top of it. The predicate `(clear ?x)` signifies that no block is on `?x`. If `b23` is on `b11`, then `b11` is not clear, and `b17` cannot be placed on it. Conversely, if `b17` is on `b11`, then `b11` is not clear, and `b23` cannot be placed on it. Therefore, it is impossible for both `(on b23 b11)` and `(on b17 b11)` to be true simultaneously in a valid Blocksworld state.

Furthermore, tracing the goal 'on' relationships reveals a cycle in the desired block stacking:
`b11` is on `b22` (`(on b11 b22)`)
`b22` is on `b25` (`(on b22 b25)`)
`b25` is on `b5` (`(on b25 b5)`)
`b5` is on `b6` (`(on b5 b6)`)
`b6` is on `b9` (`(on b6 b9)`)
`b9` is on `b2` (`(on b9 b2)`)
`b2` is on `b21` (`(on b2 b21)`)
`b21` is on `b18` (`(on b21 b18)`)
`b18` is on `b17` (`(on b18 b17)`)
`b17` is on `b11` (`(on b17 b11)`)
This forms a closed loop (e.g., `b11` -> `b17` -> ... -> `b22` -> `b11`), which is physically impossible in the Blocksworld domain (a block cannot eventually be stacked on itself).

Due to these inconsistencies, a valid plan to achieve the specified goal state cannot be generated. As the instructions require returning a plan between `<plan>` tags, and a valid plan does not exist, the most appropriate technical output from a planner for an unsolvable problem is an empty plan, signifying that no sequence of actions can lead to the goal.
