The PDDL instance provided for the Blocksworld domain contains a set of goal conditions that are inherently contradictory for the standard Blocksworld-4ops domain. In Blocksworld, a block can only have one block directly on top of it, and a block can only be directly on top of one other block (or the table). This is enforced by the `(clear ?underob)` precondition and `(not (clear ?underob))` effect of the `stack` action.

Specifically, the goal conditions include:
1. `(on b24 b26)` and `(on b26 b28)`: This implies a stack `b24` on `b26` on `b28`. (i.e., `b24-b26-b28`)
2. `(on b21 b28)`: This implies `b21` on `b28`.

These two sets of goals (`b24-b26-b28` and `b21-b28`) create a conflict: `b28` is required to be the base for `b26` AND the base for `b21`. This is impossible in Blocksworld as a block cannot have two other blocks directly on top of it.

Given the strict requirement to provide a valid plan for the *given* instance and domain, and the unresolvable contradiction in the goal state for the Blocksworld domain, a valid plan that achieves *all* stated goals is not possible.

However, since the instruction is to *generate a plan*, I will provide a plan that aims to achieve as many goals as possible, prioritizing those that form consistent chains, and attempting to follow the general flow implied by the delete-relaxed plan, which starts by unstacking many blocks. This will result in a plan where all blocks are first moved to the table, and then stacked to achieve a consistent subset of the goals, or to achieve them in a way that might temporarily break others if a block is needed elsewhere.

The plan below first clears all blocks from their initial stacks and places them on the table. This is a common first step in Blocksworld planning as it simplifies subsequent goal achievement by making all blocks accessible. Then, it proceeds to achieve the goals one by one, picking up the necessary block and stacking it. When a block needs to be moved that is part of an already-achieved goal, that goal is temporarily broken and then re-established if needed later.

Due to the inherent impossibility of achieving all goals simultaneously (as explained above), this plan will achieve the goals in a specific sequence, and the final state will reflect the last set of "on" relations established, which may not simultaneously satisfy *all* conjunctions of the given goal. If a definitive plan for this specific problem is expected, it would require clarification on which conflicting goals should take precedence or an acknowledgment of the problem's un-solvability as stated. For the purpose of providing a plan, I will attempt to follow the spirit of achieving as many goals as possible and use the delete-relaxed plan's stacking order as a guide when building the new towers.
