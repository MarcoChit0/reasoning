Prompt:
<prompt>
<problem-description-with-landmarks>
You are a highly-skilled professor in AI planning. Your task is to generate a plan for a PDDL instance from the domain <domain>blocksworld</domain>. 
You will be given the PDDL domain file, the PDDL instance file, and the set of action landmarks extract from the delete relaxation of the instance. 
Action landmarks are actions that must be part of any valid plan for the task. 
Since the action landmarks are extracted from the delete relaxation of the instance, they represent a subset of the action landmarks of the instance.
Note that the action landmarks are provided in arbitrary order and do not necessarily reflect the order in which they must appear in the plan. 
However, every valid plan must include all action landmarks at some point during execution.
You need to return the plan between the tags <plan> and </plan>. You will receive two examples to help you in generating the plan.

This is the PDDL domain file of the blocksworld domain:

This is a set of action landmarks for the Rovers instance above:

This is a plan for the Rovers instance above:

(sample_rock rover1 rover1store waypoint1)
(drop rover1 rover1store)
(communicate_rock_data rover1 general waypoint1 waypoint1 waypoint2)
(sample_soil rover1 rover1store waypoint1)

Provide only the plan for the given instance. Here is a checklist to help you with your problem:
<checklist>
1) The plan must be in the same format as the examples above.
2) The plan should be preceded by the <plan> tag and should be followed by the </plan> tag.
3) The actions in the plan must be from the set of actions in the domain described above, that is, they must use the same name and the same number of parameters as one of the action schemas.
4) The plan must be valid, that is, each action must be applicable in the state it is applied, and the plan must end in a goal state.
</checklist>
