**Fulfilling Logistics Plans with Landmark Guidance**

As a seasoned expert in this domain, I'm tasked with generating a PDDL plan for a complex logistics problem. I've been given the domain and instance files, plus a crucial piece of information: a list of *action landmarks*. These landmarks, if incorporated in their provided order, should guide the plan towards a feasible solution.

The challenge lies in the nature of these landmarks. They're not simply a list of steps to execute linearly. Rather, they represent key actions that *must* appear in the plan, and critically, their order must be respected. My core strategy will involve a state-space search guided by these landmarks. For each landmark, I'll attempt to execute it directly if its preconditions are met. If not, I'll identify and implement the minimal sequence of *additional* actions required to establish those preconditions, ensuring that the landmark remains valid. This means I will be building the plan in *action-order* as dictated by the landmarks. This approach is similar to traditional forward search planners, with the addition of strict landmark ordering.

The plan will primarily revolve around moving packages between locations across a network of cities, with trucks and an airplane as the key transportation resources. The initial plan will consist of steps to fulfill each landmark, by generating a series of `drive-truck`, `load-truck`, `unload-truck`, `fly-airplane`, and `load-airplane`, `unload-airplane` actions. These actions must ensure that the packages get to their specified destination. I need to handle all these conditions to ensure the plan's feasibility.

I'll proceed by meticulously tracking the state of each object (packages, trucks, airplane) using `at/in` predicates. By checking which objects are in which state, I'll identify the current location of the action resource and package. I'll maintain a list of all current landmarks and process them iteratively, ensuring the execution order is maintained, even if that demands generating supporting intermediate actions to establish preconditions.

The resulting plan will then be a sequence of actions that fully solves this logistics problem, respecting all package goals and landmark constraints.
