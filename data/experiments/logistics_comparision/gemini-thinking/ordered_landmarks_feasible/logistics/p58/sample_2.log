**The Challenge of Planning in Logistics**

As a planning expert, I'm tasked with devising a PDDL plan for a complex logistics problem within the `logistics` domain. I'm given the domain file, a specific instance file, and, crucially, a set of action landmarks that must be part of any solution. The puzzle lies in respecting the landmark order while efficiently achieving the ultimate goals: delivering each package to its designated location.

The instance involves various object types: airplanes, cities, trucks, locations, and numerous packages. The initial state and the desired goal states for these packages are clearly defined. A significant challenge is that packages often require transportation across cities, suggesting the use of airplanes, while others necessitate truck-based movements within a city.

The heart of the problem is interpreting the action landmarks. They are provided in a particular order, and the task requires a plan that includes these actions. However, the order doesn't dictate a rigid sequence for individual packages. The plan must satisfy all preconditions for landmark actions; if necessary, it must interleave additional, non-landmark actions (e.g., driving trucks, loading/unloading packages) to ensure the landmarks themselves can be performed when their time comes. The landmark sequence represents a feasible *relative* order, where each action must appear in the overall plan.

I need to understand this concept of landmarks: actions *must* appear in the plan, *in order*, but other actions *can* be added to meet the conditions. It's a "critical path" approach, meaning I need to insert actions as needed to fulfill the preconditions. When a landmark `LM` occurs in the list, then the goal is to make sure `LM`'s preconditions are met *then* the action is executed.

To manage this complexity, I'll need to meticulously track the locations of all vehicles and packages. As I progress through the landmark list, I will generate a plan by interweaving all actions (landmarks or not). This is achieved by creating a "critical path" planning method, where the state is maintained explicitly.
