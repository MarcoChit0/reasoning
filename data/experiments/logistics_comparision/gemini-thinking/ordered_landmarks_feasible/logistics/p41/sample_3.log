**Summary of My Planning Process**

My primary goal is to generate a valid PDDL plan for a logistics instance, given domain and instance files and a list of action "landmarks" that *must* be included in the plan and that are in a "feasible" order. As an expert in the field, I understand that landmarks represent key actions that constrain the solution space.

My initial approach involved analyzing the initial and goal states, focusing on the movement of packages via trucks and airplanes. The challenge, as I quickly discovered, lies in interpreting the "feasible order" of the landmarks, specifically in their relationship with each other in the plan.  "Feasible" can be tricky. Does that mean I can insert other non-landmark actions to satisfy dependencies, or must I respect the *order* of the landmarks strictly?  

I initially believed the landmarks implied a strict sequence of execution, but I encountered a core problem with a specific package (p9) that needed to be loaded into a truck (t0) at a location (l0-0) *before* the airplane actions that would get it there. If I took this at face value, there would be causal contradictions.

After thorough analysis, I now realize I have to work with this structure:
1.  All landmarks must appear in the final plan.
2. The relative order of the landmarks from the provided list must be preserved.

This means that if a landmark requires another landmark (that is *later* in the list) as a precondition, I must still honor that *order*, which implies extra actions to make things make sense.

I have decided to create a plan that logically moves all packages to their destinations, inserting the landmark actions, and making sure the final filtered plan contains the landmarks in the specified relative order. It's a trade-off between efficient planning and respecting the constraints. This will mean potentially inefficient movements (e.g., packages being moved back and forth) to satisfy the "feasible order". This will involve a deep analysis and careful state tracking.
