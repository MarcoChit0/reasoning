**Logistics Planning: A Landmark-Guided Approach**

My task is to generate a PDDL plan for the `logistics` domain, given a domain file, an instance file, and a set of action landmarks provided in a feasible order. As an expert in the field, I understand the inherent complexities of this problem, specifically concerning the handling of a large number of packages and the potential for a less than optimal plan when using landmarks.

**Problem Breakdown:**
My core goal is to ensure 25 packages are delivered to their respective locations, using a combination of trucks and airplanes across three cities. The initial state and goal locations are provided, and I will be using the landmark actions (e.g., loading, unloading) as constraints.

**Strategy:**
My strategy is to interpret these landmarks as the *essential* steps in *some* valid solution path. This approach allows me to make a plan by ensuring each action is included, in the correct order, and that all preconditions are met at each step.

Here's my thought process and key decisions:

1.  **Landmark Order:** The provided landmark order is crucial. I'm assuming that this order needs to be reflected in the final plan. This creates some complexities as the actions for a single package might be interleaved with those of others.

2.  **Landmark Specific Interpretation:** I will handle each action as an explicit step that *must* happen at a particular point. If a landmark action (e.g., load, unload) is specified, I must create a sequence of actions that ensure this landmark is executable in the current state, even if this means moving objects multiple times.

3.  **Round-Trip Packages:** I will accept that landmarks could suggest round trips for packages if the ordering does. If a package has to be moved to a certain location as a precondition of some landmark, and later moves away, I will allow the round trips.

4.  **Handling Vehicles:**
    *   **Trucks:** Ensure trucks are at the correct location when packages are to be loaded or unloaded.
    *   **Airplanes:** Similarly, I'll ensure airplanes are at the right airports to carry packages between cities.

**Plan Generation:**

My system needs to keep track of locations (of vehicles and packages), and which packages are loaded into which vehicles.

1.  **Iterating through Landmarks:** For each landmark, I will insert the actions necessary to move objects/vehicles as required, then append the landmark action.
2.  **Explicit State Tracking:** I need an explicit object/vehicle state to ensure the preconditions of each action are met.
3.  **Post-Landmark Goal:** I will also check after each landmark to identify actions that are needed to ensure the packages are transported to their ultimate destinations.

**Challenges and Caveats**

1.  **Suboptimal Plans:** This strategy will likely result in a valid but potentially inefficient plan because I am prioritizing the constraints imposed by the landmark order and not global plan efficiency.
2.  **Redundant Movements:** Packages may be moved multiple times due to the ordering of landmarks.

This is my basic plan to ensure the *necessary* steps are in the plan.
