The problem asks to generate a PDDL plan for a logistics instance, guided by a set of action landmarks provided in a "feasible order". The term "feasible order" implies that there exists at least one valid plan where actions appear in the same relative order as in the given landmark list. "Action landmarks are actions that must be part of any valid plan for the instance." This second statement typically means every listed landmark must be in the plan. However, when landmarks for the same object are contradictory (e.g., loading package `p2` into `t0` and also into `t1` without an intermediate unload), a strict interpretation becomes problematic.

Given the examples, and the general nature of delete-relaxation landmarks, the most practical approach is to:
1.  Maintain the current state of all objects (packages, trucks, airplane).
2.  Iterate through the provided action landmarks sequentially.
3.  For each landmark action:
    *   **If it's a `LOAD` action (`(load-truck obj truck loc)` or `(load-airplane obj airplane loc)`):**
        *   Check if the `obj` is already in *any* vehicle. If so, this landmark represents an alternative path for the `obj` which is not currently being taken; hence, skip this landmark.
        *   Check if the `obj` is at the specified `loc`. If not, this `load` action is not immediately applicable as the `obj` would need to be moved to `loc` first. Since the landmark list doesn't explicitly include all intermediate movements of a package (only high-level `load`/`unload` points), and to adhere to the "feasible order," we assume that if the package is not at `loc`, this specific `load` landmark is not currently applicable in its given context or refers to a part of the package's journey that has not yet materialized through other landmarks. Therefore, skip this landmark.
        *   If the `obj` is free (not in a vehicle) and at `loc`:
            *   Ensure the `truck`/`airplane` is at `loc`. If not, add `DRIVE-TRUCK` or `FLY-AIRPLANE` actions to move it.
            *   Add the `LOAD` action to the plan and update the state (package now in vehicle).
    *   **If it's an `UNLOAD` action (`(unload-truck obj truck loc)` or `(unload-airplane obj airplane loc)`):**
        *   Check if the `obj` is actually in the specified `truck`/`airplane`. If not, this `unload` action is not applicable; skip it.
        *   If the `obj` is in the specified `truck`/`airplane`:
            *   Ensure the `truck`/`airplane` is at `loc`. If not, add `DRIVE-TRUCK` or `FLY-AIRPLANE` actions to move it.
            *   Add the `UNLOAD` action to the plan and update the state (package now at `loc`, not in vehicle).
            *   If `loc` is the goal location for `obj`, mark `obj` as successfully moved to its goal.

This strategy respects the sequential order of landmarks as much as possible, while inserting necessary vehicle movements. It prioritizes the first applicable landmark for a package, effectively choosing one path among potential alternatives (which might be present due to delete relaxation).

Here's the detailed plan generated following this strategy:
