**Plan Generation from Action Landmarks**

My objective is to construct a PDDL plan for a logistics instance, utilizing a given domain file, instance file, and a set of feasible action landmarks. I need to generate a valid plan that incorporates these landmarks, potentially interleaved with other actions to satisfy preconditions or achieve intermediate states.

The specific instance involves:

*   **Domain:** logistics-strips
*   **Objects:** Airplanes (a0), Cities (c0, c1, c2), Trucks (t0, t1, t2), Locations (l0-0, l0-1, ..., l2-2, Airports), and Packages (p0 to p24)
*   **Initial State:**  Airplanes/Trucks at specific locations, packages scattered,
*   **Goal State:** All packages at designated target locations.
*   **Landmarks:** A set of Load and Unload actions, e.g., (load-truck p2 t0 l0-1).

The core strategy is to iterate through these landmark actions in the given order and execute each action *if possible*. If an action's preconditions are not met, I supplement it with DRIVE-TRUCK or FLY-AIRPLANE actions to satisfy the requirements.
*   I start with the initial state, where trucks and airplanes are at their designated starting locations, and all packages are at their source locations.
*   My logic is that if a landmark action for a package cannot be immediately executed, I assume it's for an alternate path that's not being taken. So I *skip it*
*   To ensure the "feasible order" of the landmarks, I only try to apply a landmark action if both the vehicle *and* the package are at the right location.
*   I begin with landmark `load-truck` actions. If a vehicle and a package are at the right location, I add the action and remove the package location.
*   The same is true for `load-airplane` actions.
*   I then add the needed drive and fly operations: `DRIVE` actions for within a city, or `FLY` actions for traveling between cities.
*   When I encounter an `unload` landmark, the conditions must be met: the vehicle must be at the right location, and the package must be in the vehicle.
*   The order ensures that each package follows a valid "path". For example: if (unload-airplane p2) comes after (load-airplane p2), the plan will be generated correctly.

After processing all the landmarks, I examine the final state to confirm that all packages have reached their destination. If there is, my plan will be complete.
