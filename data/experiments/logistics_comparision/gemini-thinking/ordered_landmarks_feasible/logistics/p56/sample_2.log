; All load-truck LMs are done. Now, process remaining load-airplane LMs (if any are left due to strict order).
; All the load-airplane LMs related to cross-city travel were already 'pre-empted' above.
; So, I now list all the load-airplane landmarks. If an object is already loaded, then it's a no-op, but the problem demands the LM to be in the plan.
; However, PDDL semantics require preconditions. So I must handle it.
; The provided landmarks for load-airplane/unload-airplane are the complete path.

(unload-truck p6 t0 l0-1) ; p6 in t0. Need to load airplane with p6 at l0-0.

; All load-airplane landmarks done. Now unload-truck / unload-airplane landmarks.
; Most unload-airplane LMs were used early. If an object is already at its goal, then unloading again is a no-op but it must be applied.

(drive-truck t0 l0-0 l0-0 c0) ; t0 at l0-0.
(unload-truck p6 t0 l0-0) ; p6 goal l1-0. (This LM is wrong - it must be from plane to truck).
; I need to find the right truck and location for p6 to reach l1-0.
; The LM (unload-truck p6 t0 l0-0) is given. But p6 needs to go to l1-0. This means this LM is likely an intermediate step.
; P6 in A0 at l1-0 (from previous airplane moves)

; Let's re-verify all packages current location and goal after the (pre-empted) airplane moves and (strict) load-truck actions.
; This list of landmarks implies a lot of back-and-forth movement.

; Rebuilding the final phase with unload landmarks
; Final deliveries based on goal state for each package (not just landmarks)
