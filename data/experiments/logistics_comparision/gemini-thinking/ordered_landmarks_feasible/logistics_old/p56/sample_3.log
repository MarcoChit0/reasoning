**Alright, let's get this logistics plan sorted!**

My task is to whip up a PDDL plan for this `logistics_old` domain. I've got the domain and instance files, along with some helpful action landmarks to guide me. My goal is to orchestrate the delivery of 29 packages, making sure they all end up at their designated destinations.

First, I need to understand the initial setup. We've got:

*   **Airplanes:** `a0` chilling at airport `l2-0` (in city `c2`).
*   **Trucks:** `t0` in `c0`, `t1` in `c1`, and `t2` in `c2`.
*   **Packages (OBJ):** Each package has its own starting point and target. There are a total of 29 packages to deliver.

**Strategy is simple:**
1.  **Follow the Landmarks:** Use those landmarks as a checklist, ensuring I meet all the preconditions before each action.
2.  **Trucks for Short Hauls:** Trucks are great within a city. If a package is going within the same city, it's truck time!
3.  **Airplanes for the Big Moves:** Airplanes are the intercity specialists. Packages need to be trucked to an airport, loaded onto an airplane, flown, and then trucked again to the final destination.

I'll be careful to insert the `drive-truck` and `fly-airplane` actions to fill in the missing steps and make the plan work.

**Let's get to the plan!**

I'll carefully construct each action that's needed to deliver each package.
The action landmarks I have help immensely in this process.
