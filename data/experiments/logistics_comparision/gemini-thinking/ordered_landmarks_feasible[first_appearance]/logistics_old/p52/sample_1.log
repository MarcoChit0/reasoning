**Comprehensive Logistics Plan Generation**

Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. I've been handed a classic logistics problem, "logistics\_old," and it's my job to whip up a PDDL plan that gets those packages where they need to go, all while respecting a set of predefined landmarks. I have all the necessary domain and instance files, along with an ordered list of actions to guide my planning.

Here's the gist: the domain is "logistics-strips" and we're dealing with airports, cities, trucks, and, of course, a mountain of packages. I've meticulously mapped out the initial state, pinpointing the starting locations of each truck, airplane, and package.  The goal is crystal clear: get all 27 packages to their final destinations.

The challenge? These landmarks.  They give me a roadmap, but I need to ensure the plan adheres to this specific sequence. My internal logic is critical: I've learned that these landmarks aren't absolute instructions - they give a *feasible order*, meaning any plan following these actions, including other possible actions, must succeed.

The core of my approach is methodical: I'll carefully consider each landmark, checking its preconditions, and then figuring out the minimum set of *non-landmark* actions needed to satisfy those preconditions.  Think of it like laying the groundwork before following the instructions, like ensuring a truck is in the right city, or making sure the airplane has landed. I use an `at` and `in` tracking mechanism to keep the truck and package locations synchronized.

The main obstacle I faced was understanding the flexibility of the landmarks.  I first realized that my plan was broken because I was getting an error, and had to re-evaluate how I was interpreting the "feasible order". That "flexibility" allows me to introduce any other action required *before* the landmarks are used. I learned it's more about ensuring preconditions are met *at* the landmark's appearance in the list.

The current plan goes like this:
1. Load trucks with packages.
2. Ensure trucks drive packages between cities
3. Airplanes pick up packages.
4. Unload packages.
5. Repeat between all packages until goals achieved.

Using this strategy, all preconditions have been met and the plan achieves all goals: all packages are at goal locations. This plan respects landmark order and is successful!
