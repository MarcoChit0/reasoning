**Fulfilling Logistics Requests in a Strips Domain**

Okay, here's the game plan for the logistics-old domain, boiled down to my internal monologue. I'm aiming for a PDDL plan to get those packages to their destinations, using the provided landmarks as my GPS.

First things first, I've got the domain: `logistics-strips`.  Lots of cities (c0, c1, c2), airports, trucks (t0, t1, t2), airplanes (a0), and a heap of packages (p0 through p24) scattered around.  The initial state's a bit chaotic, but the goal is crystal clear: get every package where it needs to be.

The landmarks are my key, they present the plan. Since they're "feasible," I'll try to weave them into the solution directly.

I'm starting by grouping objects and their destinations. I need to move them around. For intercity moves I'm using the airplane. I need to get trucks to the airport (t0,t1,t2) at different times for load and unload actions. I started by getting truck t1 with load actions.

The landmarks involve loading trucks, planes, and unloading. I start by focusing on getting the trucks at the correct location, then on the airplane. I need truck t1 at l1-2, then trucks with l2-2 and so on.

*   **t1, l1-2**:  T1 goes to l1-2, loads packages, takes to l1-0 (airport)

*   **t0, l0-1**: t0 needs to pick up, and will take it to l0-0 (airport)

*   **t2**: t2 picks up packages at location l2-2 and will take them to l2-0 (airport)

*   **a0 at l1-0** loads/unloads packages.

The landmarks act as guides and constraints, so I must stick to them. It means loading t1 with several packages. The airplane has to follow the plan. I check the landmarks to make sure I am following them. I must make sure t1 takes to airport at l1-0. Next step is fly to location l0-0.

After these steps, now the plane will take them where they are going. This means the other plan follows with unloading at the different locations (the goals).

I have to carefully incorporate the truck trips to pick up objects at their initial locations and travel to the airports.  The landmarks guide me in putting all the pieces together into the right sequence of moves to get all the packages to their final destinations.
