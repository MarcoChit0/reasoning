**My Thinking on Planning with Landmarks**

Okay, so I'm facing this logistics problem, and I've got a PDDL instance with a whole lot of packages, trucks, an airplane, and a list of "landmarks." My job is to generate a plan that gets all the packages to their final destinations while *respecting* these landmarks. The catch? The landmarks are actions that *must* be included in the plan, and the *order* mattersâ€”at least for their *first* appearance.

I've broken the problem down. I know the domain, the objects, and the initial and goal states. Now, the landmarks. They're my guiding light, but their meaning is a bit foggy.

I've wrestled with a few interpretations. At first, I thought the landmarks were *suggestions*, but the phrasing "must be part of any valid plan" ruled that out. It seems I *must* use every landmark. The real tricky part is "the order only needs to be respected for the first appearance of each landmark." Does that mean I have to *strictly* follow the list, even if it's inefficient? Or does it mean the landmarks are like, goal "flags" that must be *activated* in order?

I've tested various interpretations. One hypothesis: if an action `X` is `(load-truck p3 t0 l0-0)`, and it's LM1, and action `Y` is `(load-truck p3 t1 l1-2)`, and it's LM2, then I have to plan such that both appear. If `(load-truck p3 t1 l1-2)` happens first, I've *still* satisfied the constraint of "first appearance". But then I'm also obligated to get p3 to location such that I can use `(load-truck p3 t0 l0-0)`

My current best guess is this: The landmarks aren't specific action *orderings*, but a list of *goals*. These must be met in order. I can build a plan to take p3 to any position it needs to be, but I have to use *at least* one of the loading actions listed as landmarks. However, if two actions are `(load-truck p3 t0 l0-0)` and `(load-truck p3 t1 l1-2)` and it is *possible* to use both, then I must first load `p3` using `t0` before I can load it using `t1`.

The goal is to generate a valid plan that *includes* all the landmarks in the provided order, no matter how inefficient it might be.
