**A Deeper Dive into Logistics Planning with Landmarks**

Okay, here's my understanding of how I'm going to tackle this logistics planning problem with the provided landmarks. The core of it all is understanding how the "feasible order" of the landmarks actually works.  

The problem gives me a set of actions (the landmarks) that *must* be included in any valid plan.  But the "feasible order" means the plan *could* follow that order for the first occurrence of a landmark.  After that, it's more like these landmarks are *goals* that need to be met, but not necessarily in a strict sequence for an individual package or object.

The initial state sets the scene: trucks and the plane are at different locations, and packages are scattered around. The goal is to get all these packages to their designated final spots. The *real* challenge lies in taking the list of "landmarks" (actions like `load-truck`, `unload-truck`, and `fly-airplane`) and figuring out the complete plan, making sure all the preconditions are met.

What I'm doing is this:
*   **The Landmark Keeper**: I'm using a `landmarks_used` set to keep track of the landmarks I've already included. This is super important because of the "first appearance" rule.
*   **Precondition First**: Before I add a landmark action, I *must* make sure its preconditions are met. This means if I have a landmark that says "load package 'p6' onto truck 't0' at location 'l0-2'," I first need to get 'p6' to 'l0-2'.  If it's already on another truck, I've got to unload it.  And if the truck needs to *be* there, I have to *move* the truck there first.
*   **Helper Functions**: To make things easier, I've built some helper functions:
    *   `handle_obj_movement` - This figures out the shortest path for a package to move, whether it's by truck within the city or by plane to another city. It also handles the loading and unloading.
    *   `add_action_to_plan` - This one's crucial. When I add an action (either from my *landmark list* or generated by my helper functions), it checks if that action is *also* a landmark. If so, it adds it to the plan *only* if it hasn't been used yet (hence, `landmarks_used`).  This guarantees that I respect the landmark order for their "first appearance," which is what the problem demands.
*   **A "Move Everything" Approach**: Basically, I iterate through the landmark list, and for each landmark:
    1.  If this landmark has *already* been included, skip it (because itâ€™s been taken care of).
    2.  If the landmark is *new*, make sure all the necessary preconditions are met (e.g., package at the correct location, truck at the correct location).
    3.  Call the action.
*  **Meeting The Goals**: After I'm done processing the landmarks, I make one last pass to make sure *all* the packages are at their *final* destinations.
*   **Duplicate Removal**: Finally, I go through the plan and remove any duplicate actions, keeping only the most essential ones.

In essence, I'm building the plan by stitching together the landmarks and generating necessary intermediate steps to ensure that the goal conditions for each landmark are met.  The key is that I interpret the order of the landmarks as a *guideline*, ensuring that those specific actions *happen* but allowing flexibility in *how* they occur to efficiently achieve the goal state.
