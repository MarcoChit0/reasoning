**Okay, let's break this down.** My goal is to craft a logistics plan, so I've been given domain and instance files, along with an ordered list of landmark actions.  I need a valid plan to move a bunch of packages to their destinations, making sure to follow that landmark order.

First, the big picture: I need to get 29 packages to specific places. Most are in one city, need to go to another, or within the same city.

I've got the lay of the land: three airports (in cities c0, c1, and c2), trucks at each airport, and a plane at the c2 airport. Packages are scattered everywhere.

The key is understanding the actions.  I've got load/unload truck, drive truck, load/unload airplane, and fly airplane. The landmarks are critical; they're like breadcrumbs showing the way. I need to figure out where to drive trucks, when to fly, and how to get these packages where they need to go.

Here are the goals, and the initial locations for each package:

*   p0, from c0 to c1.
*   p1, from c1 to c2.
*   p2, from c1 to c0.
*   p3, from c1 to c2.
*   p4, from c1 to c2.
*   p5, from c1 to c2.
*   p6, from c0 to c2.
*   p7, from c1 to c0.
*   p8, from c0 to c1.
*   p9, from l0-1 to l0-2 (same city, different location)
*   p10, from c0 to c2.
*   p11, from c2 to c0.
*   p12, from l2-1 to l2-0 (same city, different location)
*   p13, from c1 to c0.
*   p14, from c1 to c0.
*   p15, is already at its goal location, l2-2. **Skip.**
*   p16, from l1-1 to l1-2 (same city, different location)
*   p17, from c2 to c0.
*   p18, from c0 to c1.
*   p19, from c2 to c0.
*   p20, from c1 to c0.
*   p21, from c1 to c2.
*   p22, from l1-2 to l1-1 (same city, different location)
*   p23, from c1 to c0.
*   p24, from l1-1 to l1-2 (same city, different location)
*   p25, from c0 to c2.
*   p26, from c2 to c1.
*   p27, from l2-2 to l2-1 (same city, different location)
*   p28, from l1-1 to l1-2 (same city, different location)

Knowing these locations helps me plan. p9, p12, p16, p22, p24, p27, and p28 need internal moves in their cities. All others need to fly.

The plan will be roughly: trucks pick up packages within cities or take them to the airport, then the plane flies packages between cities, and trucks unload to their final destination.

I will process the list of landmarks and add truck moves and plane flights to fulfill them.

Starting with the landmarks, and keeping track of each truck's position:

Initially, `t0` at `l0-0`, `t1` at `l1-1`, `t2` at `l2-0`, `a0` at `l2-0`

Processing Landmarks:

1.  Pick up package 9. Then add "p9 needs to be unloaded".
2.  I then realize that `load-truck p21 t2 l2-0` is not the initial load. p21's starting position is not l2-0. I need to load `p21` in a plane before `t2` can unload it.
3.  Load package 28 in `t1`.
4.  And so on.
5.  Load package 7 in `t1`.
6.  Load package 16 in `t1`.
7.  Take package 17 to t2.
8.  I
