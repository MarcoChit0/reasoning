**Refined Plan Generation for Logistics Domain**

As an expert in planning, I'm tasked with generating a PDDL plan for the `logistics` domain, given a domain file, an instance file, and a feasible, ordered list of action landmarks. The critical constraint here is that the plan must respect the order in which each landmark appears for the *first time* in the plan, even if that means temporarily violating the ideal object-centric landmark order.

The domain involves objects of types `OBJ`, `TRUCK`, `LOCATION`, `AIRPLANE`, `CITY`, and `AIRPORT`. Actions include `LOAD-TRUCK`, `LOAD-AIRPLANE`, `UNLOAD-TRUCK`, `UNLOAD-AIRPLANE`, `DRIVE-TRUCK`, and `FLY-AIRPLANE`, each with specific preconditions and effects defined by the problem. The goal is to move packages (`p0` to `p30`) from their initial locations to their respective target locations.

The core challenge lies in handling the action landmarks. They represent critical steps in any feasible plan. My task is to weave the actions around these landmarks, ensuring the plan's validity and adherence to the first-appearance constraint.

I'll process each landmark sequentially. If a landmark's preconditions aren't met, I'll execute preparatory actions. These actions, which are often *other* landmarks or non-landmark actions, will ready the world for the target landmark. This look-ahead capability, integrated with state tracking, is vital.

Here's my approach:
1.  **State Representation:** I maintain a detailed state representation of the world, including the location of objects (`at_obj`), vehicles (`at_truck`, `at_airplane`), and the contents of vehicles (`in_truck`, `in_airplane`).
2.  **Landmark Management:** I use a set (`landmarks_executed`) to track actions that have been added to the plan, ensuring each landmark is used only the first time.
3.  **Action Resolution (`resolve_package_to_loc`):** This helper function is key. Its task is, given a package and a target location, to move the package there. It constructs sub-plans as needed, considering inter-city or intra-city moves. This method now considers that a package may be in a truck or airplane.
4.  **Iterative Processing:** The core algorithm iterates through the ordered landmark list. For each landmark action (`L`):
    *   If `L` is *already* in the plan, I skip it.
    *   I verify the preconditions for `L`.
        *   If the vehicle is not in position or the object is not in the correct location (often packages for the load, or locations for the unload), then I call `resolve_package_to_loc` or move a vehicle to the appropriate location to fulfil preconditions.
    *   If preconditions *are* met, I add the action to the plan, apply the effects, and add the landmark to the `landmarks_executed` set.

This approach ensures the plan respects the landmark order. By pre-planning sub-movements, the critical "first appearance" aspect of the landmarks is handled properly. In this manner, I believe I will generate the correct solution.
