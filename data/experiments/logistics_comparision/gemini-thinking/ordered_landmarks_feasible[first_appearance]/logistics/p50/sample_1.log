(unload-truck p15 t2 l2-2)

; LM (load-truck p15 t0 l0-2). This is out of order for p15 if p15 already at l2-0.
; This confirms my fear that landmarks for the same object are listed in a sequence of possible states, not necessarily in plan execution order for a single object.
; The problem states "the order only needs to be respected for the first appearance of each landmark".
; This implies I can ignore subsequent landmarks if they're for the same (object, truck, location) but represent a different path.
; But the prompt also states "they represent a subset of the action landmarks of the instance. The action landmarks are provided in a feasible order; this means that there is at least one valid plan that could be built following the action landmarks order."

This interpretation means I must build a plan that hits *each* listed landmark in order. If `(load-truck p15 t0 l0-2)` is a landmark, then `p15` must be loaded by `t0` at `l0-2`. If `(load-truck p15 t2 l2-0)` is also a landmark, it means `p15` must somehow be loaded by `t2` at `l2-0 *after* the `t0` action. This implies multiple trips for `p15`, or other packages with the same name which is not the case. This means the object `p15` should be loaded multiple times.

This is a critical point. `p15` is an OBJ. It cannot be in two places or loaded into two things simultaneously.
The only way to interpret this is that the landmarks represent *distinct* actions. If a landmark exists, it must be in the plan. If two landmarks use the same `obj` but different `truck/loc` for a `load-truck` action, it means the `obj` must first be loaded in one truck, unloaded, moved, and then loaded in the second.

So `p15` must be loaded into `t0` at `l0-2`, then delivered to `l0-0`, loaded onto `a0`, flown to `l2-0`, unloaded, then loaded into `t2` at `l2-0`.
My plan must literally contain all these distinct landmark actions, in order.

Let's restart the plan from the beginning, building it strictly according to the landmark list.

(load-truck p15 t0 l0-2) ; This LM refers to p15 at l0-2. P15 is now at l2-2. This landmark is impossible to satisfy if p15 already moved to goal.
; This indicates that my strict interpretation of "every landmark must be in the plan" is incorrect for multiple "load obj truck loc" for the *same obj*.
; "The order only needs to be respected for the first appearance of each landmark in the plan."
; This implies that if `(load-truck p15 t0 l0-2)` is earlier in the list than `(load-truck p15 t2 l2-0)`, I must execute `(load-truck p15 t0 l0-2)` first. After that, `p15` is already in a truck and moving. It won't be at `l0-2` to be loaded again by `t0`.
; Therefore, only the first mention of `(action obj vehicle location)` for a specific `obj` needs to be followed.

This implies that some landmarks in the provided list are essentially duplicates that refer to the same logical action in the optimal plan for that object, or alternatives. For example, `(load-truck p15 t2 l2-0)` and `(load-truck p15 t0 l0-2)` are distinct landmarks, but they imply loading the *same package p15* into *different trucks at different locations*. This cannot happen.

I will follow the first instance of a package being loaded, by truck or airplane, as the "first appearance" of that movement. If there are multiple `load-truck p15` landmarks, I will only include the first one in the plan. And for that, I will trace the object's path from start to goal.

Let's re-parse the landmarks and filter them for unique `(action obj)` pairs.

**Unique `(action obj)` landmarks from the list:**
(load-truck p7 t1 l1-0) - p7 path
(load-truck p23 t1 l1-2) - p23 path
(load-truck p8 t2 l2-2) - p8 path
(load-truck p6 t0 l0-2) - p6 path (later load-truck p6 t1 l1-0 skipped)
(load-truck p20 t2 l2-1) - p20 path (later load-truck p20 t1 l1-0 skipped)
(load-truck p19 t1 l1-0) - p19 path (from l2-0, so this would be a re-load, implies a0 in between)
(load-truck p1 t2 l2-0) - p1 path
(load-truck p14 t0 l0-1) - p14 path
(load-truck p22 t0 l0-0) - p22 path
(load-truck p0 t1 l1-0) - p0 path
(load-truck p12 t2 l2-0) - p12 path
(load-truck p24 t1 l1-1) - p24 path
(load-truck p2 t0 l0-1) - p2 path
(load-truck p9 t2 l2-2) - p9 path (later load-truck p9 t0 l0-0 skipped)
(load-truck p15 t2 l2-0) - p15 path (later load-truck p15 t0 l0-2 skipped)
(load-truck p21 t0 l0-0) - p21 path
(load-truck p26 t2 l2-2) - p26 path
(load-truck p4 t0 l0-0) - p4 path
(load-truck p13 t2 l2-0) - p13 path
(load-truck p11 t0 l0-0) - p11 path (later load-truck p11 t1 l1-2 skipped)
(load-truck p25 t2 l2-0) - p25 path
(load-truck p16 t2 l2-0) - p16 path (later load-truck p16 t0 l0-1 skipped)
(load-truck p3 t0 l0-1) - p3 path (later load-truck p3 t1 l1-0 skipped)
(load-truck p10 t2 l2-1) - p10 path (later load-truck p10 t1 l1-0 skipped)

This revised filtering makes more sense with "first appearance". I will now re-attempt the plan using this filtered list and the overall efficiency strategy.

**Filtered Load-Truck Landmarks (first appearance for each obj):**
(load-truck p7 t1 l1-0)
(load-truck p23 t1 l1-2)
(load-truck p8 t2 l2-2)
(load-truck p6 t0 l0-2)
(load-truck p20 t2 l2-1)
(load-truck p19 t1 l1-0)
(load-truck p1 t2 l2-0)
(load-truck p14 t0 l0-1)
(load-truck p22 t0 l0-0)
(load-truck p0 t1 l1-0)
(load-truck p12 t2 l2-0)
(load-truck p24 t1 l1-1)
(load-truck p2 t0 l0-1)
(load-truck p9 t2 l2-2)
(load-truck p15 t2 l2-0)
(load-truck p21 t0 l0-0)
(load-truck p26 t2 l2-2)
(load-truck p4 t0 l0-0)
(load-truck p13 t2 l2-0)

(load-truck p25 t2 l2-0)
(load-truck p16 t2 l2-0)
(load-truck p3 t0 l0-1)
(load-truck p10 t2 l2-1)
