; This is extremely messy. Let me restart with the batching strategy I outlined, it should be easier to follow for the landmarks.

; --- REGENERATING PLAN WITH BATCHING ---
; Plan structure:
; 1. Trucks gather all packages in their city and take inter-city ones to local airport.
; 2. Airplane does rounds, picking up at source airports, dropping at destination airports.
; 3. Trucks deliver intra-city and newly arrived packages from destination airports.

; Current state:
; t0 at l0-1, t1 at l1-2, t2 at l2-1, a0 at l2-0
; All packages at initial 'at' locations.

**My Logistics Plan: A Detailed Roadmap**

Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to orchestrate the movement of a bunch of packages (`p0` to `p28`) in the `logistics` domain. I've got the domain and instance files, plus a list of "action landmarks" – which I see as key steps in the plan. My job? Generate a *valid* plan that hits all the delivery targets and, critically, respects the *order* those landmarks first appear in.

Here's my thinking:

1.  **Grasp the Goal:** Move packages to their final destinations. Simple, right? But the devil's in the details: there are a *lot* of packages!
2.  **Analyze the Starting Lineup:** Where are things at the beginning? I need to check the locations of:
    *   `a0` (the airplane), and trucks `t0`, `t1`, and `t2`.
    *   Each package's starting point:  `p0`, `p1`, etc., all the way to `p28`.
    *   Cities (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`) and the locations (`l0-0`, `l0-1`, etc.) within them.
    *   Airports: the critical hubs for air travel.
3.  **Inspect the End Game:** What's the target? The `(at ?p ?loc)` goals – each package at its designated spot.
4.  **Landmark Decode:** The landmark list is the puzzle's blueprint. The order is significant, but I need to figure out what it's really telling me about efficient transport.

Here's my general plan pattern.

**My Basic Inter-City Movement Recipe**
1.  Truck `LOAD`: Package onboard.
2.  Truck `DRIVE`: Take truck to the right airport.
3.  Truck `UNLOAD`: Packages from the truck.
4.  Airplane `LOAD`: Package to airplane.
5.  Airplane `FLY`: From origin airport to destination.
6.  Airplane `UNLOAD`: Offloads.
7.  Truck `LOAD`: Pick up from the airport.
8.  Truck `DRIVE`: Towards final destination.
9.  Truck `UNLOAD`: Offload.

If they're local, just the truck steps.

**Initial Considerations:**
*   Trucks might be able to batch deliveries within a city.
*   The airplane (`a0`) will be key for long distances.

I start by building some of the simple local moves with the trucks.
I examine the landmarks. For instance, `(load-truck p6 t0 l0-1)`: `p6` is at `l0-1` and so is `t0`. Easy, for now.
However, I have to keep track of *all* the package locations in a more dynamic way, even when packages need to move by truck, then plane, then truck.
The goal for `p6` is to get it to `l1-0`, which requires the airplane.

Landmark Analysis Leads to this:
1.  **Key Steps for Delivery:** Truck loading, driving, and unloading and Airplane Loading, Flying, Unloading.
2.  **Efficient Planning** Track each package's location.
3.  Ensure landmark order. This is tough, there's always a first appearance, I think.
4.  If I reach a landmark action, and the objects aren't in place, I *must* generate the action to place them for the delivery.
5.  In general, I will construct a plan following all given landmarks and add all prerequisites in the most efficient manner, respecting the given order.

This gives me the strategy to build the plan, step by step, following the landmarks and generating the plan.

I will attempt to batch package deliveries when the destinations or pickup locations are co-located.
I see the given "feasible order" of landmarks as *a* valid solution pathway.

**The Strategy Implementation.**
I generate the plan by tracking the vehicles, the objects that they carry.

**The Goal:**
The goal is to generate the plan. It's the order that's key. So, by ensuring each landmark is in place I will achieve the goals. This will involve truck driving and flying, to place each of the 28 packages at their goal location.
