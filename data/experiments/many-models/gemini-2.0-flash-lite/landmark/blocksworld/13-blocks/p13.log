You are a highly-skilled professor in AI planning. Your task is to generate a plan for a PDDL instance from the domain <domain>blocksworld</domain>. You will be given the PDDL domain file, the PDDL instance file, and the set of action landmarks for the instance. Action landmarks are actions that must be part of any valid plan for the task. You need to return the plan between the tags <plan> and </plan>. You will receive two examples to help you in generating the plan.
</problem-description-with-landmarks> 

This is the PDDL domain file of the blocksworld domain:
<domain-file>
(define (domain blocksworld-4ops)
(:requirements :strips)
(:predicates
(clear ?x)
(on-table ?x)
(arm-empty)
(holding ?x)
(on ?x ?y)
)
(:action pickup
:parameters (?ob)
:precondition (and (clear ?ob) (on-table ?ob) (arm-empty))
:effect (and (holding ?ob) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (on-table ?ob))
(not (arm-empty)))
)
(:action putdown
:parameters (?ob)
:precondition (holding ?ob)
:effect (and (clear ?ob) (arm-empty) (on-table ?ob)
(not (holding ?ob)))
)
(:action stack
:parameters (?ob ?underob)
:precondition (and (clear ?underob) (holding ?ob))
:effect (and (arm-empty) (clear ?ob) (on ?ob ?underob)
(not (clear ?underob)) (not (holding ?ob)))
)
(:action unstack
:parameters (?ob ?underob)
:precondition (and (on ?ob ?underob) (clear ?ob) (arm-empty))
:effect (and (holding ?ob) (clear ?underob)
(not (on ?ob ?underob)) (not (clear ?ob)) (not (arm-empty)))
)
)
</domain-file>

This is the PDDL instance file, for which you need to generate a plan:
<instance-file>
(define (problem BW-rand-13)
(:domain blocksworld-4ops)
(:objects b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8 b9 b10 b11 b12 b13 )

(on-table b8)
(on b9 b12)
(on b10 b1)
(on b11 b8)
(on b12 b3)
(on-table b13)
(clear b6)

)
(:goal

(on b5 b13)
(on b6 b1)
(on b8 b5)
(on b10 b4)
(on b12 b11))
)
)
</instance-file>

This is a set of action landmarks for the instance you need to generate a plan for:
<landmarks-set>
(pickup b8)
(pickup b1)
(stack b8 b5)
(stack b1 b12)
(stack b2 b6)
(stack b10 b4)

(stack b5 b13)
(stack b6 b1)

(unstack b9 b12)
(unstack b2 b4)

(unstack b4 b11)
(unstack b5 b2)
(unstack b6 b5)

Provide only the plan for the given instance. Here is a checklist to help you with your problem:
<checklist>
1) The plan must be in the same format as the examples above.
2) The plan should be preceded by the <plan> tag and should be followed by the </plan> tag.
3) The actions in the plan must be from the set of actions in the domain described above, that is, they must use the same name and the same number of parameters as one of the action schemas.
4) The plan must be valid, that is, each action must be applicable in the state it is applied, and the plan must end in a goal state.
</checklist>
