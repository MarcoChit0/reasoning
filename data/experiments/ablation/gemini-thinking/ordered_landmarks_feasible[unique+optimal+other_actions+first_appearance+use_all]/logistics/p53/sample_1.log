**Summary of Logistics Planning Process**

My primary goal here is to craft a valid PDDL plan for the `logistics` domain. I'm given the domain and instance files, along with a list of action landmarks that *must* be included in the plan. The tricky part is ensuring that I follow the order in which the landmarks *first* appear in the plan, while respecting their preconditions and achieving the overall goal.

I'm starting with a deep dive into the problem: understanding the setup, including the domain (logistics-strips), all the objects (AIRPLANEs, CITIES, TRUCKS, OBJECTs and their locations), the initial state, and the ultimate goal. The goal is straightforward: all packages need to reach their designated destinations.

My main challenge is in interpreting the landmark list, and applying them in the given order of appearance. I must ensure all the packages are at their *respective* goal locations, which may not be the same as their current location, but, importantly, including the list of landmarks. I have determined that since the landmarks appear in the list in order of their *first* appearance, that might *not* be the same order in which they will occur.

I've developed a robust strategy: process the landmarks one-by-one, in the order they're given. For each landmark, I first check if the *landmark* action is in the `executed_landmarks` set. If it is, then it's already done so skip it. Next, I need to make sure the preconditions are met for the landmark action. If it is not, then I must add any actions *before* the landmark in the plan, such as `drive-truck` and `fly-airplane` to meet those preconditions. Once all the preconditions are met, I add the landmark to my plan, I update my state, and I add that landmark to my `executed_landmarks` set.

For the core of my plan, I've created a *recursive* function called `ensure_obj_at_loc(obj, target_loc)`. This is the brain of the operation. It handles moving packages (represented by objects) to the correct locations. Inside this, I've had to consider the logic for handling intercity and intra-city package movement, as well as ensure the required trucks and airplanes are at their required locations by recursively adding the necessary actions.

The key to success is in carefully processing the preconditions for each step, and inserting any missing steps to *guarantee* that the landmarks can be successfully incorporated into the final plan. This requires a thorough analysis of both the individual landmarks and how they link together to get each package from its origin to its destination.

Finally, I plan to run through the entire process, including the application of the auxiliary `ensure_obj_at_loc`, and generate a valid plan for this logistics problem.
