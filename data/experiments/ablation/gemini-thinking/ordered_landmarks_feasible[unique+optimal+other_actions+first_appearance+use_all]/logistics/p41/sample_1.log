**Plan Generation and Landmark Adherence in a Logistics Domain**

Alright, let's dive into this logistics problem. My primary objective is to create a PDDL plan that not only gets all the packages to their destinations but also strictly adheres to a set of provided action landmarks. These landmarks are crucial, as they represent constraints derived from a delete-relaxed planning phase. The challenge lies in integrating these landmarks, which dictate the sequence of particular actions, into an efficient plan.

**The Initial Setup**

I have the domain file, which defines the general rules, and the instance file, which specifies the current state of the world, including the locations of airplanes, trucks, and packages. My expert intuition guides me to analyze the starting and goal states meticulously. This involves identifying the packages' origins and destinations, which directly informs my transportation strategy. The existing configuration shows:
*   **Airplanes:**
    *   `a0` at `l1-0` (airport in city `c1`)
*   **Trucks:**
    *   `t0` at `l0-1` (location in city `c0`)
    *   `t1` at `l1-1` (location in city `c1`)
    *   `t2` at `l2-0` (airport in city `c2`)
*   **Packages (OBJ):**
    *   `p0` at `l1-2` (c1) -> Goal: `l0-2` (c0)
    *   `p1` at `l1-1` (c1) -> Goal: `l1-1` (c1) (already at goal)
    *   `p2` at `l0-0` (c0) -> Goal: `l2-2` (c2)
    *   `p3` at `l1-2` (c1) -> Goal: `l0-2` (c0)
    *   `p4` at `l1-2` (c1) -> Goal: `l2-1` (c2)
    *   `p5` at `l1-2` (c1) -> Goal: `l1-0` (c1)
    *   `p6` at `l1-0` (c1) -> Goal: `l0-2` (c0)
    *   `p7` at `l0-1` (c0) -> Goal: `l0-2` (c0)
    *   `p8` at `l1-2` (c1) -> Goal: `l2-1` (c2)
    *   `p9` at `l2-0` (c2) -> Goal: `l0-1` (c0)
    *   `p10` at `l0-2` (c0) -> Goal: `l2-0` (c2)
    *   `p11` at `l2-2` (c2) -> Goal: `l0-0` (c0)
    *   `p12` at `l1-1` (c1) -> Goal: `l0-2` (c0)
    *   `p13` at `l1-2` (c1) -> Goal: `l0-2` (c0)
    *   `p14` at `l0-0` (c0) -> Goal: `l2-0` (c2)
    *   `p15` at `l0-2` (c0) -> Goal: `l2-1` (c2)
    *   `p16` at `l0-1` (c0) -> Goal: `l0-0` (c0)
    *   `p17` at `l1-1` (c1) -> Goal: `l2-2` (c2)
    *   `p18` at `l1-0` (c1) -> Goal: `l0-0` (c0)
    *   `p19` at `l0-0` (c0) -> Goal: `l2-2` (c2)
    *   `p20` at `l2-2` (c2) -> Goal: `l1-0` (c1)
    *   `p21` at `l1-2` (c1) -> Goal: `l0-2` (c0)
    *   `p22` at `l
