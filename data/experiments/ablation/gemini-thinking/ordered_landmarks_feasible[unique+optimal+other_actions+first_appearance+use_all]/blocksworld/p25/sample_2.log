**Blocksworld Planning: A Landmark-Guided Approach**

Alright, here's the game plan for this blocksworld problem.  My mission is to devise a PDDL plan that gets the blocks from their initial scrambled arrangement into the desired goal state.  The twist?  I've got to respect the order of these "landmark" actions, which are essentially key steps that *must* be part of any valid solution.

First, I need to understand the domain.  Blocksworld is simple, but the challenge is ensuring the plan works efficiently and correctly.  I'm dealing with four basic actions: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`.  Each action has preconditions (like "the arm must be empty") and effects (like "the arm is now holding a block").  The challenge lies in orchestrating these actions to build the correct block towers.

The bulk of the work involves figuring out the sequence of actions that achieves the goal state while respecting the action landmarks order. I'm taking a very direct approach. First, I unstack every block (except what is already clear on the table), then put them down, ensuring the arm is free for other actions. After that, I follow these action landmarks to guide my stacking strategy:

1.  **Unstack all blocks:**  If a block is on another block, I must first unstack it and put it down.  If a block is on the table, it becomes clear.
2.  **Stack blocks into goal towers:**  Now, using the landmarks as hints, I start stacking blocks into the desired towers, and I must introduce any necessary `pickup`, `putdown`, and `stack` instructions to make it all work.

To make sure my plan works, I'm doing meticulous "bookkeeping." I track the state after each step. So, I have all the actions, with the state updates after each.

Here's the problem: The goal `(on b6 b12)` is conflicting because I have a landmark and the requirement. So, I added actions in the plan to take it down and re-place it after other actions. 

This approach should guarantee that I achieve the goal state.
