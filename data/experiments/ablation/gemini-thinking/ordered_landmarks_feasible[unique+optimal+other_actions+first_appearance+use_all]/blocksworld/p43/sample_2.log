**The Algorithm of my Mind**

Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a PDDL plan to solve this blocksworld puzzle. I've been given a domain, an instance, and some action landmarks. The landmarks are a roadmap, but I need to handle any preconditions and potentially throw in some extra actions to make everything work. The objective is to get every `(on ?x ?y)` condition to hold true.

Here's my thought process:

1.  **Initial Assessment**: First, I'll identify the starting state. I'll make a list of all the initial `on`, `on-table`, `clear`, and `arm-empty` conditions. Then, I'll do the same for the goal state - a list of the desired `on` predicates. This sets the stage.

2.  **Landmark Follow-Through**: Now for the main show. I'm going to process the landmarks in the suggested order. For each one, I need to make sure its prerequisites are met. If they're not, I need to figure out the necessary actions (unstack, pickup, putdown, stack) and insert them into the plan. After an action, I'll update the state.

3.  **Finish Strong**: After I work through all the landmarks, I'll check if the goal is completely satisfied. If not, I'll tack on any extra actions to make sure those remaining `on` conditions are met.

**Here's the Plan**

To build the plan, I'm going to follow this approach. To get all blocks on the table. Then, I'll use the stack landmarks.

Okay, let's go.
```pddl
(unstack b11 b29) ; I must putdown if I have to stack later, because this order of landmarks could make it impossible to stack later.
(putdown b11) ; All temporary actions, place the blocks on the table
