**Blocksworld Planning: A Landmark-Guided Approach**

Alright, let's dive into this blocksworld puzzle. The user wants a plan, and I'm tasked with generating one that nails all the goals while respecting these "landmarks" â€“ key actions that *must* be included. The catch? These landmarks come from something called "delete relaxation," which means they might not align perfectly with the *final* goal state.

First, I analyzed the scene: blocks everywhere, the arm is empty, and a whole list of initial states and a detailed goal state, plus an order of landmark actions. My initial impression is a lot of stacking and unstacking. I'll need to figure out how to arrange the blocks and how to insert necessary actions.

The main problem pops up with `(on b1 b15)`. It's true at the start, but then a landmark says to `unstack b1 b15`.  This leads me to think, the plan is not that simple. I must take those into account. So, the landmark is not that bad. It's just a step for the final. I must arrange necessary actions in between the landmark sequence so I will make sure the goal conditions are achieved.

So, I read over the problem description. "Feasible order" means there's a plan, but the landmarks might not get me there *directly*. The order only needs to be respected the first time each landmark pops up. This means the plan can be built to reach the correct goal states.

Then, there's `(stack b18 b1)`... But I can't be sure it's valid. Also, if I have `(on b1 b15)` goal then I cannot achieve it in such way so it will work. I will follow the plan, but I must make sure that it will be achieved in the final. After this, let's assume those are all correct.

The plan I have to devise involves:
1. Clearing the way: Unstacking blocks from their starting positions and placing them temporarily on the table.
2. Respecting the Landmarks: Inserting pickup and stack actions around the landmarks and ensuring that preconditions are met.
3. Placing all necessary blocks by goal condition.

I start building the plan from the initial state, adding actions to meet the landmark prerequisites at each stage, making sure the final goal state is achieved. This is a sequence of actions that will follow through.

This approach will make sure I will use all the actions and the conditions. I checked all the final steps.

This final process is as: `UNSTACK`, `PUTDOWN`, `PICKUP`, and `STACK`. At the last, there are all final results by all the goal requirements. Everything worked!
