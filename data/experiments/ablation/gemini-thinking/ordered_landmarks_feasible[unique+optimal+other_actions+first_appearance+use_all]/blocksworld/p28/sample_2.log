**Plan Generation for Blocksworld Instance**

Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a PDDL plan for this blocksworld instance. It needs to satisfy all the desired goal conditions, stick to the provided action landmarks in the order they're given, and of course, be a valid plan wrapped in `<plan>` tags.

The problem, in a nutshell, boils down to moving blocks around to create stacks. Here's my thought process:

1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The final arrangement of blocks is clearly stated. We need these specific block combinations to be `on` each other.

2.  **Understanding the Initial State:** The starting point is a bit chaotic, with blocks stacked in various configurations, and some blocks on the table.

3.  **Analyzing Action Landmarks:** The landmarks dictate the core sequence of moves. They're a mix of `unstack`, `pickup`, and `stack` actions. The `unstack` actions are front-loaded, which makes sense because many blocks have to be unstacked from their original positions to create the desired stacks. Importantly, I must maintain the given order.

To start, I'm tracing the state, applying actions step by step. I'm focusing on the first landmarks. It all starts with the `unstack b16 b17` landmark, which I need to execute first.  To get `b17` clear, I'll need to use `(putdown b16)` on the table, likely as a temporary measure.

My plan begins to build the following way:
1.  **unstack b16 b17**
2.  **putdown b16**

Now, before the next landmark `(unstack b17 b9)`, I need the arm to be empty. So I put down the block I am holding after `unstack b16 b17`. The crucial part, remembering that I can put other actions between landmarks. Now, I have to follow the other landmarks, which is repeating the cycle of `unstack` then `putdown` until most blocks are cleared. I repeat the process of unstacking a block and placing it back down on the table to make blocks available and clear for stacking. This sequence of unstack-putdown actions repeats until blocks are stacked together as per the landmark instructions.

Once most of the blocks are on the table, I start assembling the goal stacks based on the goal state, but also remembering that the blocks may only be moved in a valid sequence. I also remember to take actions according to the state change. I then check the landmarks to continue the process. I have the sequence of the unstack operations.  Now I need to repeat a sequence of the pickup and stack operations.

Since all of the `unstack` landmarks are done, let's move on to the `stack` actions:

For each stack landmark `(stack ?ob ?underob)`:

*   I check if `?underob` is clear. If not, I need to clear it.
*   Check if `?ob` is `holding`. If not, `pickup ?ob`.
*   Perform `stack ?ob ?underob`.

All the stacking landmarks get picked up. This completes all stacking landmark steps, but one goal condition remained:  `(on b11 b13)`. This means to achieve this goal, I must `pickup b11`, and `stack b11 b13`. This must be performed, as it is a final condition. Now my plan is completed!

After carefully verifying each step, the total plan is 66 steps long and completely satisfies the goal conditions while respecting the given landmarks.
