**Pondering a PDDL Plan for This Blocksworld Puzzle**

Okay, so I've been tasked with generating a plan for this blocksworld problem, and the main constraint is to respect the given landmarks.  The landmarks are essentially a suggested order of actions, and I've got to work within that structure. The crux of this is to make sure I don't violate any dependencies along the way.  I've analyzed the initial and goal states, and it's clear I'll need to do some reordering internally to manage the dependencies.

First, I need to understand the stacks I'm dealing with. Looking at the initial state, I've identified five stacks, and it's all about ensuring that blocks get moved in an orderly fashion. My strategy starts with a disassembly phase. In this part of my plan, I focus on "unstacking" actions that help free up the blocks at the top of each stack. Then, after that part of my analysis, I realized that I would need to implement an additional stack to satisfy the feasible order property.  I had to place (stack b11 b13) between (stack b13 b22) and (stack b15 b11).

In the assembly phase, I'll be implementing the "stack" actions in the order provided, interspersed with the necessary "pickup" actions, and now with the one (stack b11 b13) I added.

It looks like the landmarks are a feasible starting point, but I'll need to insert "pickup" actions to make sure the right blocks are on the arm at the right time.  The "putdown" actions will come into play to clear the way. The plan I will devise has to make sure that each "on" relation in the goal state is created by a corresponding "stack" action and must satisfy all of the necessary preconditions.
