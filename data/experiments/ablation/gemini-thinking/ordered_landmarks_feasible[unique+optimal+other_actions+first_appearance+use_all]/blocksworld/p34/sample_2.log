**Detailed PDDL Plan for Blocksworld Instance**

Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: generate a valid PDDL plan for a given blocksworld instance, ensuring all landmarks appear in order and the final state satisfies the goal conditions. I have the domain, the instance, and a set of ordered action landmarks.

My initial approach is to treat this as a landmark-guided planning problem. I'll meticulously process each landmark in its prescribed order. If a landmark's preconditions aren't met, I'll insert necessary actions to satisfy them. This will include picking up any block I need to use, stacking to reach the goal condition or clearing space, and putting the arm down when not needed.

The instance I'm working with has blocks stacked in an initial configuration. I am carefully tracking the state transitions, specifically the *clear* predicates (which a block is clear for stacking or holding), *on* relations (where the blocks are on top of each other), *on-table* (blocks are now clear and can be stacked on) and the arm state (`arm-empty` and `holding`).

The core of the strategy is simple blocksworld principles: to manipulate a block, I must first ensure it is clear and my arm is empty. If an intermediate state is needed, I must move the blocks on top of it to the table to make space to meet pre-conditions of another state.

I've examined the initial state and goal. The goal state specifies the final arrangement of the blocks. I'm going to follow the landmarks one by one, ensuring the preconditions of each are met. If a block isn't where it needs to be, I'll insert unstack and putdown actions to place the block on the table and make space. To stack an object, it must be `clear` and the arm must be `holding` that object.

The landmark list is my guide. These actions must be executed in order. Let's start processing the landmarks one at a time and tracking the state. The critical step is to identify the necessary `pickup`, `stack` (or the goal), and `putdown` actions to execute. I am also checking the final state to make sure all goal conditions are met. I have to be careful about *clear* predicates.
The solution will not be optimal. It will get all goals met.
I also have to manage the blocks to prevent conflicts between pre-conditions.
I will have to insert `putdown` actions to make space to solve landmarks.
The landmark list is `(unstack), (stack)` style. First will be putdown, then stack.
In between `unstack` and `stack`, I will *always* add `putdown` because `holding` must be false for `arm-empty` true.

I've carefully examined the initial state to create the landmarks and generate the plan. If I needed to add the missing stack landmark that gets the final goal `(on b18 b23)`. I have created a fully valid PDDL plan.
