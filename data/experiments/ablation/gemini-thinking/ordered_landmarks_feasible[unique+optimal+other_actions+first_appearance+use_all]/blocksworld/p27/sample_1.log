**Alright, let's break down this planning problem.** My task is to generate a PDDL plan for the `blocksworld-4ops` domain, given an initial state, a goal state, and a *feasible ordered* set of action landmarks. This means I need to arrange a series of actions that respects the order in which these landmarks *first* appear. I'm free to introduce other actions to meet preconditions and ensure a proper plan.

First, I need to understand the blocksworld. The domain involves blocks, the table, and a robot arm. I know my actions: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`. The *landmarks* are key actions that I *must* include in my plan, in the order given. The main strategy is usually to unstack blocks to get them clear and put them in the desired goal state.

The initial state is a mess of blocks stacked in arbitrary ways. The goal state, on the other hand, wants the blocks arranged in a completely new configuration. My strategy will be to simulate the plan step by step and track the current state, ensuring I meet all prerequisites for each action before executing it.

I start by systematically processing the landmarks. My analysis indicates that the plan will be based on unstacking, then re-stacking. *Crucially*, the order of landmarks doesn't perfectly correspond to the final goal. So, I will need to insert actions based on the goal.

The initial strategy will be to process the landmarks in the provided order and use other actions (like `putdown`) in between when needed.

For example, I start by tracking what I need to do to satisfy each landmark. If the landmark can't happen right now, I need to know why and insert the actions to satisfy the landmark preconditions.

I soon encounter a core issue: the landmark set. At a certain point, a landmark would unstack a block that is *required* to stay stacked, so I need to insert a step. At the goal step, I realized that I may not be given the full set of necessary actions (as the goals may require additional actions that aren't landmarks). So I added the missing action to the set.

After processing all landmarks, I build my final plan, carefully inserting necessary `pickup` actions for any stacked block to be rearranged, checking that it follows the landmark's initial order, and verifying that the final state matches the goal state. The goal state must include all the goal predicates.
