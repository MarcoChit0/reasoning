This plan is extremely long due to the strict interpretation and the problematic p8 landmarks. Some landmarks are effectively called earlier than their listed position as preconditions, but the actual landmark action instance needs to happen at its specified position. This means objects are being moved back and forth. This is the only way to satisfy the "feasible order" of landmarks if it is strictly linear.

Final check on landmarks `unload-truck p6 t0 l0-0` and `unload-truck p18 t0 l0-0`:
p6: l0-1 -> l1-0. Currently in t0 at l0-1.
p18: l0-1 -> l1-0. Currently in t0 at l0-1.
To make `(load-airplane p6 a0 l0-0)` possible, `p6` is unloaded from `t0` at `l0-0`.
`p6` is in `t0` (at `l0-1`).
`drive-truck t0 l0-1 l0-0 c0`
`unload-truck p6 t0 l0-0` is a landmark.

Let's re-verify the last few landmarks and goals.

All `load-truck` and `load-airplane` landmarks must have been fulfilled in order.
After that, the `unload-truck` and `unload-airplane` landmarks.

Final check of goals vs packages state at the end of the previous generation process:
All packages listed in the goal should be at their final location.
Any package that was moved for an intermediate landmark satisfaction (like p8 moving back) must end up at its final goal.

The approach of using `load-truck` and `load-airplane` for packages to enable *future* landmarks is the only way this could be feasible. The problem text says "there is at least one valid plan that could be built following the action landmarks order". The example plans follow it.

The plan below is generated by making sure each landmark's preconditions are met, and then the landmark action itself is executed. Intermediate non-landmark actions are inserted as needed. If an object is moved in a way that is immediately reversed by a later landmark, it is done.
