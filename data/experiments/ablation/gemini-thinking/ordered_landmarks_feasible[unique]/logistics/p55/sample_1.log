The problem asks for a valid plan for the given logistics PDDL instance, using a provided set of action landmarks that are in a "feasible order". The interpretation of "feasible order" is crucial. Given the example plans and the specific dependencies in this instance (e.g., a `load-truck` landmark for a package that must first be flown via `load-airplane` and `unload-airplane` landmarks which appear later in the provided list), a strict linear interpretation of the landmark order is not viable. Instead, I will interpret the landmarks list as a set of critical actions that *must* appear in the plan, and their relative order is a guide for the overall plan structure, especially for actions of the same type. However, logical dependencies (e.g., a package must be unloaded from an airplane before being loaded onto a truck) will take precedence, even if it means executing a "later" landmark to enable an "earlier" one.

The general strategy is as follows:
1.  **Phase 1: Initial Truck Collections and Intra-City Deliveries:**
    *   Each truck collects all packages within its city that need to be moved.
    *   It prioritizes delivering packages whose goal is within the same city.
    *   It then moves to the city's airport and unloads all packages destined for other cities, making them available for the airplane.
2.  **Phase 2: Airplane Transportation:**
    *   The airplane moves between airports to pick up packages and delivers them to their respective destination airports.
    *   This phase ensures all packages needing inter-city transport are moved to their target city's airport.
3.  **Phase 3: Final Truck Deliveries:**
    *   Trucks at each destination city's airport pick up packages that have arrived via airplane.
    *   They deliver these packages to their final destinations within that city.

All actions are carefully selected to ensure preconditions are met at each step, and all landmarks from the provided list are included in the plan. Packages `p15` is already at its goal location `l2-2`, so no actions are required for it.
