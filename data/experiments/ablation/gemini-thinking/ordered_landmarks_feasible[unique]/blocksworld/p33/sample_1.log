**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm going to solve this Blocksworld planning problem:**

I need to create a plan that gets from the initial block arrangement to the goal arrangement, while sticking to a set order of actions (the landmarks). I've got the domain rules, the initial state, the goal state, and the landmark actions in order. My goal is to craft a plan that does exactly what it needs to do to achieve the required stacks, and I think I've got a good idea of how to do that.

My general strategy is to go through the landmarks one by one.  For each landmark action, I'll first check if its prerequisites are true in the current state. If not, I'll add the necessary `pickup` or `putdown` actions to get those prerequisites ready. If, during the process, I encounter a new landmark, I'll ensure preconditions for that are true as well, inserting actions to achieve that as needed.

I've already analyzed the domain rules and the problem's starting and ending states. Now I'll proceed with each landmark, building the plan step-by-step, inserting any required actions along the way, ensuring that all those precondition states are met. I have to think about what is *not* clear, and how that will affect the next stack.
