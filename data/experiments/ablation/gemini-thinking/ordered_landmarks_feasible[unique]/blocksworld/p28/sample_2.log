**Blocksworld Planning: A Step-by-Step Approach**

As an expert in planning, I'm presented with a blocksworld problem: I need a valid PDDL plan to rearrange blocks from an initial state to a goal state.  I have the domain, instance, and a crucial set of "landmarks" â€“ key actions in a feasible order.  My task is to weave these landmarks into a coherent plan while ensuring all preconditions for each action are satisfied.  This is what I have determined will happen:

Initially, I analyze the block arrangement. In the initial configuration, I identify which blocks are "clear" (no other block on top). This is crucial since blocks need to be clear to be moved. I also deduce that any action must have the arm empty as the initial step, then identify the clear blocks b1, b6, b8, b16, b21.

The strategy hinges on two phases: *unstacking* and *stacking*, as indicated by the landmark order. I process unstacking first to clear the blocks by placing them on a table and clear the arm. I proceed by applying the unstack operations for the blocks on the table, if possible.
I add a few extra actions, like `putdown` and `pickup` as needed to the plan, given that these operations are required for any block arrangement process.

To correctly generate a successful plan, I have to address the key challenge. The tower of blocks `b15 b11 b13 b22` has been identified as a significant issue. To address this, I will need to introduce a step to stack `b11 b13` as a required intermediate stage to satisfy `b11 on b13`.  Because the initial structure is to remove all the stacks. Then to reconstruct the stack given the goal states.

As I construct the plan, I methodically follow these steps:

1.  **Examine the initial state:** Determine which blocks are clear. Identify `clear b1, clear b6, clear b8, clear b16, clear b21.` Also, b1, b6, b8, b16, b21 are the only clear blocks.
2.  **Unstack Phase:** Use the list of landmarks. Start unstacking by putting the top block on the table (if necessary).
3.  **Stack Phase:** With the table empty for unstacked blocks, use the list of landmarks to perform these actions.
4.  **Special Handling:** Because the landmark list requires to construct `b15 on b11, and then b11 on b13, and then b13 on b22`, the actions of `pickup` and `stack` are required to achieve the goal state. Thus, an insertion of the stack action for `b11` and `b13` is needed as an intermediate goal state.

Throughout, I monitor the state of each block (clear or not clear), the arm status (empty or holding), and the on relationships. By meticulously tracking these details, I ensure that each action is valid, given the current state.
The final plan must satisfy both the landmark actions and the goal state predicates.
