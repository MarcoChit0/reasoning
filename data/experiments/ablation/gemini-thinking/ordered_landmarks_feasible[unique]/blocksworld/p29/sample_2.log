**Plan Generation for Blocksworld Instance**

My task is to create a PDDL plan for a specific Blocksworld scenario, using the provided domain, instance, and a sequence of "action landmarks." These landmarks, presented in a feasible order, guide the construction of a valid plan.  I'll start by thoroughly understanding the initial and goal states, focusing on the "on" relations between blocks.

The core approach involves sequentially processing each action landmark. For each landmark, I'll assess its preconditions. If these preconditions aren't met, I'll strategically insert auxiliary actions like `pickup` and `putdown` to ensure all requirements are satisfied before applying the landmark.  It’s crucial to keep track of the current state after each action.

I have a particular interest in the goal condition `(on b18 b17)`. The initial and goal states tell me `b18` *is already* on `b17`, so I must consider this a necessary precondition. My understanding of blocksworld informs me `b21` would *also* have to be stacked on `b18`.

I'll proceed to list the initial state predicates and the on predicates from the goal state.  I must make sure no blocks are left on top.  I need to ensure the plan satisfies all the goal conditions, especially `(on b18 b17)` *and* also meet the order of landmark actions.

Starting with unstacking landmarks, I will put each block back on the table.

In the case of the problematic `(on b18 b17)` condition, the provided landmarks suggest a conflict. Since `(unstack b18 b17)` is an unstacking command,  and `(stack b21 b18)` comes later, my plan needs to work around this.  I must follow the landmark order and satisfy all of the goals.  If it's necessary to insert auxiliary actions I must.  I need to check the state, and insert pickup actions as needed.  In order for this plan to be valid, I will assume the landmark's list will be followed, since it’s stated that it's given in a valid order, and if so all goals should be true in the final state.

The key to resolving the `(on b18 b17)` issue is strategically inserting auxiliary actions. I will add `pickup` and `putdown` actions to make `(clear b17)` true before `b18` is stacked, but this is a red herring. It also implies the plan has other missing components and therefore the goals can not be met.

Therefore I have to follow the list and put the `(on b18 b17)` state, to satisfy this goal, but the instructions require there to be a stack operation between the unstack and the stack, to include the `(stack b18 b17)` to create this state. I then had to add those in, ensuring the preconditions were met.  I will then review all the goals and make sure the predicates are added.  I can then say my plan is complete.

I carefully constructed the final plan.
