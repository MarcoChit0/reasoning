**Synthesizing a PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

As an expert in planning, I've approached this task by carefully analyzing the problem setup and the constraints imposed. The challenge is to devise a plan to transform an initial blocksworld state into a desired goal state, leveraging a set of provided "action landmarks." These landmarks, extracted from a delete-relaxed version of the problem, represent key actions that must be part of any valid solution, and crucially, they are presented in a feasible order. This means that if I adhere to this order and correctly manage preconditions, I should be able to derive a workable plan.

My primary strategy is to break down the planning process into stages, systematically processing the landmarks while carefully maintaining the state of the world. First, I thoroughly understand the initial and goal states, noting the initial configuration of blocks and the desired final arrangement.

The first step is a phase of unstacking. I meticulously execute the `unstack` landmarks in their given order, interspersing them with necessary `putdown` actions to handle blocks that are not immediately stacked elsewhere. This clearing phase simplifies the world by ensuring that blocks previously stacked on others are placed on the table, freeing up space and preconditions. At this phase, I need to ensure that the arm is empty, and I `putdown` blocks on the table.

Then, the second stage is stacking. In this phase, I examine the stack landmarks. For each `stack` landmark, I introduce a `pickup` action immediately prior to the `stack` action, ensuring that the necessary preconditions are met. Because the `landmark` list did not provide an ordering for all goals, I'm careful that the steps I added to meet the `goal` have to precede the step that is dependent on the goal conditions being met.

To address the key goals `(on b9 b18)` and `(on b11 b19)`, I realized that I needed to insert a non-landmark `stack` action to achieve the goal state. These stacks (`b9 b18`) and (`b11 b19`) are placed before the stack actions mentioned in the landmarks to ensure that the goals are reached.

The final plan will be a sequence of `unstack` and `putdown` to clear the state, along with the stack landmarks with their prerequisites of `pickup`. This sequence also includes two auxiliary stack actions for the goals, placed at the appropriate time to ensure the proper blocks are stacked at the right time.
