**The Comprehensive PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, let's break this down. The objective is clear: generate a PDDL plan for this Blocksworld instance, making sure we adhere to the given action landmarks and respect their order as much as possible. It's a classic problem, so let's use a clear, logical, and systematic approach.

First things first, I needed to understand the starting point. I looked at the goal state to get my bearings on the final block configurations. Then I examined the initial state to see where we were starting from. These are the basic components in any planning problem. Next, I took a look at the actions, breaking them down into their preconditions and effects. The key here are `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`.

The landmarks are the crucial part. I see that the landmark plan begins with lots of `unstack` operations. This suggests that the initial strategy is to clear the table, which seems sensible to allow the blocks to be re-arranged more easily later.

The first step is a lengthy sequence of `unstack` operations. Following the landmarks, I inserted `putdown` actions to make sure that the arm is always empty before the next unstack action, thus maintaining `arm-empty`. Next, I needed to start stacking. I inserted `pickup` actions, as the preconditions of stacking required that blocks are available to stack.

So I built the PDDL plan based on all `unstack` and `stack` landmarks, inserting all the necessary `pickup` and `putdown` actions as needed. After completing the `unstack` phase, I saw that all blocks were on-table and clear. That was a good sign that things were moving in the right direction. All blocks are on the table and clear after the first phase. The subsequent plan involved the stacking phase, where `pickup` and `stack` actions are interleaved. The goal in this stage is to meet all the goal predicates by following the stacked landmarks.

But here is where things got tricky. Because the initial state predicates were also a part of goal configuration, they had to be re-stacked after they were used as the supporting tower, which needed `unstack` to occur first, and re-stack after all landmarks. So a greedy method won't always meet the goals here.

The final step addresses the remaining goals, specifically those that involve "re-stacking" blocks. I recognized that if a goal stack had been interrupted, it was necessary to first get rid of the stacked block that was in its way and re-stack it at the end to satisfy all goals.

By combining these strategies—following the landmark order, inserting necessary actions, and re-evaluating goal conditions—I constructed a complete and correct plan. The plan effectively clears the table, restructures the blocks based on the given landmarks, and ensures that the final goal state is achieved. A classic blocksworld problem that requires attention to details in order to be successful!
