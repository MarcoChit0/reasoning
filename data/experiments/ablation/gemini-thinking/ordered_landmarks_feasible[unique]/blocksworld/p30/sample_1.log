**Refined Blocksworld Plan for Given Instance**

Okay, so I've been tasked with generating a plan for a `blocksworld-4ops` instance, and it's got some interesting constraints.  I need to get a PDDL plan that not only reaches the goal state, but also respects a provided sequence of *action landmarks*.  These landmarks are crucial because they're essentially mandatory steps in any valid solution.  Since the landmark actions are given in a "feasible order," that suggests there's a good plan to be made by following that order as much as possible, inserting any necessary actions to achieve prerequisites or intermediary states.

Let's break down how I'm going to approach this.  First, I've got to understand the initial state—basically, what's the starting arrangement of the blocks? Then I need to understand what the final arrangement—the *goal state*—is. Next, I will process those action landmarks one at a time.  For each landmark action, I'll need to check if its preconditions are already met in the current state. If not, I'll have to find a sequence of other actions (that may *not* be in the landmark list!) to get those preconditions satisfied.  Then, I'll apply the landmark action and update the current state.  Finally, after I've processed all the landmarks, I'll have to see if the goal is completely achieved. If not, I'll have to figure out the steps to finish it off.

I've already gone through the initial state, taking note of the clear blocks. I made some corrections along the way as I discovered that some things that *looked* like clear blocks actually had other blocks stacked on top, such as block 6, or block 24.
I need to be very precise about this, or my plan will fail.

I've also listed the initial clear predicates based on the provided `on` facts of the instance. I've re-evaluated that all blocks not stacked on others are considered clear, in the instance.
Initial state for `clear`:
(clear b1)
(clear b2)
(clear b3)
(clear b4)
(clear b5)
(clear b7)
(clear b8)
(clear b9)
(clear b10)
(clear b11)
(clear b12)
(clear b13)
(clear b14)
(clear b15)
(clear b16)
(clear b17)
(clear b18)
(clear b19)
(clear b20)
(clear b21)
(clear b22)
(clear b23)
(clear b25)
*not clear for b6, b24*

Goal: (and
(on b1 b15)
(on b2 b3)
(on b3 b7)
(on b4 b13)
(on b5 b20)
(on b7 b1)
(on b8 b12)
(on b10 b18)
(on b12 b17)
(on b13 b25)
(on b14 b19)
(on b15 b11)
(on b17 b14)
(on b20 b6)
(on b21 b9)
(on b22 b8)
(on b24 b21)
(on b25 b16))

I have an "unstack everything then stack everything" idea to start.
This means I must apply all the landmarks for unstacking first.

Unstack sequence:
1.  `(unstack b2 b7)` - Then I'll have to `(putdown b2)` because the arm will be holding it.
2.  `(unstack b7 b13)` - Then `(putdown b7)`.
3.  `(unstack b13 b5)` - Then `(putdown b13)`.
4.  `(unstack b5 b14)` - Then `(putdown b5)`.
5.  `(unstack b14 b10)` - Then `(putdown b14)`.
6.  `(unstack b10 b19)` - Then `(putdown b10)`.
7.  `(unstack b19 b23)` - Then `(putdown b19)`.
8.  `(unstack b23 b11)` - Then `(putdown b23)`.
9.
