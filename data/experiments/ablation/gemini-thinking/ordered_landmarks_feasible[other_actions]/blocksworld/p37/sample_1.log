**A Detailed Blocksworld Plan for an Expert**

Alright, let's dive into this blocksworld problem. My task is to construct a PDDL plan to achieve a set of specific "on" relations, essentially restacking a set of blocks from their initial configuration to a desired goal state. The complexity lies in the number of blocks (31!) and the required goal relations. It's clear this is going to be a multi-step process involving a lot of unstacking and restacking.

I have the domain file, the initial state, and a pre-ordered set of "action landmarks." These landmarks, when executed in sequence, are supposed to achieve the goal. My initial assessment is that this is likely a form of delete-relaxation heuristics; there's no guarantee the landmark order is the *most* efficient, just that they provide a path to a solution. I'll need to interleave these landmark actions with necessary "putdown" and "pickup" actions to make them valid.

My primary strategy is to:

1.  **Achieve Preconditions:** Before each landmark action, I will ensure that its preconditions are met. This often means unstacking any blocks on top of the target block or picking up a block if it's on the table.
2.  **Execute Landmark:** Execute the specified landmark action (unstack or stack).
3.  **Update State:** Update the state based on the action executed.
4.  **Repeat:** Continue this process until all landmarks are processed, and the goal state is achieved.

Let's start tracing the landmark actions, meticulously tracking the state at each step.

*   **Landmark 1: (unstack b13 b20)** This looks simple; since b13 is on b20, and the arm is empty (both true initially), I can directly unstack b13 from b20.
*   **Landmark 2: (unstack b20 b9)** Now, b20 is the target, but I have to put down the holding b13, and then unstack b20 from b9.
*   **Landmark 3-24**: I'll repeat the 'putdown and unstack' cycle to clear the necessary block pairs. These landmarks appear designed to fully free up the blocks on-the-table.

It becomes clear that these initial landmarks are systematically unstacking every block from the initial configuration to the point that most blocks are placed on the table, essentially providing a set of blocks to build the final stack arrangements. These initial steps clear the way, providing the blocks from the on-table starting state to become available for 'stack' operations.

*   **Landmark 25 - 55:** Then the landmarks shift to `stack` actions. At this point, I have to ensure the arm picks up each block and stacks it on top of the right block, given the initial goal. If a block to be stacked is on the table, I will pickup this block and then stack it. Otherwise, I will 'putdown' the holding block to pick up the stack, if the arm is not clear.

After meticulously working through each landmark and adding those intermediate actions, my complete plan is generated with 96 actions - a mix of `unstack`, `putdown`, `pickup`, and `stack` actions. It ensures the plan will solve the problem and reach the goal state. I am confident that this plan will successfully rearrange the blocks from the initial state to achieve the desired "on" relations. Now, I have a working PDDL plan!
