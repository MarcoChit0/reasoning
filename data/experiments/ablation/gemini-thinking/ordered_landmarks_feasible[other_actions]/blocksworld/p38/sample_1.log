**Blocksworld Planning: A Landmark-Guided Approach**

I'm tackling a blocksworld problem, aiming to create a PDDL plan. I've been given the domain and instance files, plus a list of "action landmarks" â€“ actions that *must* be included in any valid solution. My strategy revolves around these landmarks.  I'll start with the initial state and generate a plan incrementally, ensuring that the *order* of the landmarks is preserved.

The core of this problem is that landmarks represent intermediate steps, and that blocks must be made clear to be moved. I'm taking the conservative approach that unless told otherwise, if the goal state requires it, I'll unstack the block. I will use the *putdown* action after *every* unstack to guarantee that the arm is free and there are not unintended interactions.

My strategy is to consider the actions in the provided order of the "action landmarks". These "landmarks" are a type of constraints within a valid plan. Initially, my assumption was that if a landmark involves moving a block from position A to position B, then the intermediate state should have the intermediate blocks on the table. Later on, this putdown-and-pickup strategy turned out to be too simplistic when considering the goal state and the landmarks.

The initial strategy was:
1.  Unstack everything, putting each block on the table (via putdown).
2.  Then, use the `pickup` and `stack` landmarks in sequence, building the desired structure.

However, after running through the actions, it appears that for a final goal state where an `on` condition must be maintained (or where it is already true), there are some actions which will destroy an initial goal (e.g. `(on b9 b18)`) and not re-create it.

To solve this problem, I will need to use a more complex sequence:
1. Process all `unstack` landmarks and put down the blocks.
2. If `(on b9 b18)` is still true in the initial state, *then unstack* all the blocks (which requires putting blocks on the table).
3. Process all the `stack` landmarks, *in order*. Some intermediate states *must* be considered at all steps. The goal and landmark sequence may *not* be a simple mapping.
4. If a goal like `(on bX bY)` is true at the final state, and the state has `(unstack bX bY)`, I should add intermediate `stack` actions: such as `(pickup bX)` and `(stack bX bY)` at the *very* end of the plan.

This strategy ensures the landmarks are followed, and any unstack actions have `putdown` as the following action to ensure arm empty. If an `on` condition must be satisfied by a specific stack that is not explicitly in landmarks, I can still make it come true.

After considering this, I've constructed a plan that carefully executes each landmark action while ensuring that all preconditions are met. Additionally, I've added a few extra actions to the end to ensure the final goal conditions (such as the unstack then re-stack for (on-b9-b18)) are true.  I believe this strategy yields a complete and valid plan.
