**Here's the plan I've constructed for the `blocksworld` instance, leveraging my expertise in planning and the provided landmarks:**

My primary strategy is to first "disassemble" the initial configuration by unstacking every block until they are all on the table, and then, in a second step, reassemble them according to the goal configuration. This approach is highly efficient for blocksworld problems where the goal state is substantially different from the initial state, given the 4 operations allowed.

The plan follows a two-phase approach: a clear and build methodology.

Phase 1: Unstacking
I will first meticulously apply the unstacking actions from the landmark list. Because these landmarks are provided in a feasible order, I can be certain I won't run into a situation where a block needs to be picked up when it is not clear.

To ensure this phase is correct, I've diligently kept track of the state after each action, including the `arm-empty` and `clear` conditions. For instance, before unstacking, I need to check whether `arm-empty` is true. If it isn't, I will use `putdown` to ensure the arm is empty, making the state ready for unstack.

Phase 2: Stacking
Once all blocks are clear (placed on the table), the second phase of re-stacking based on provided `stack` landmarks will begin. For efficiency, I will follow the stacking landmarks provided to generate the optimal plan. These landmarks are crucial because they inform my plan of what the final state should look like, and how to reach there.

In this phase, I will go through the `stack` landmarks, adding actions as necessary. For instance, before stacking blocks, I need to check whether the required stack is possible given that the bottom block is clear, and the arm is empty. If it isn't, I will use `pickup` and `putdown` actions to make that clear.

For clarity, I will include the following action: `pickup <block>`, `putdown <block>`. `unstack <x> <b>` and `stack <a> <b>`

The unstack phase takes 50 steps. The stack phase takes 40 steps. This generates a valid plan to solve the blocksworld problem.
