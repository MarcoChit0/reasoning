**Pondering the PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Right, so I'm presented with a classic Blocksworld problem, but with a twist: action landmarks. I need to craft a PDDL plan, but I'm given a set of crucial actions that *must* be included and in the correct order. The challenge is figuring out all the "glue" actions – the `pickup`, `putdown`, `unstack`, and `stack` – to make it work.

I'm thinking, "Let's break this down systematically." I've got the domain file with its actions and predicates, and the instance file defining the initial and goal states.  I'm focusing on those landmarks, because they're the skeleton of my solution.  These landmarks are crucial, so let's use those! I'll track the state of the blocks, arm, table, etc., as I fill in the details.

Starting with the plan, I first identify the "stacks" within the initial state. For this step, I'm thinking of `unstack b13 b6`. At the start, the preconditions are `(on b13 b6)`, `(clear b13)`, `(arm-empty)`. This is true at the initial stage, so it can be unstacked.

So I run `unstack b13 b6`, this makes the goal `(holding b13)` and `(clear b6)`, with `b13` now held.  The goal for `b13` is to stack `b13` on `b9`. Well, b9 is buried under other blocks, so I need to put `b13` down on the table with `putdown b13`.  So now b13 is on the table, and b9 is likely to be freed later.

Now I am at landmark `unstack b18 b7`. `b18` is clear, and `b7` is free, and the arm is empty, and I'll go ahead and execute. And I'll put it down, which is `putdown b18`. The I run `unstack b7 b14`, and I find that the destination `b6` is available!  I'll immediately run `stack b7 b6`.

I continue this way, action by action, and for the intermediate blocks, such as `b14`, I'll use `putdown b14`, but find later that's not good!  I have to adjust that later. I see that landmark 3 is `unstack b7 b14`. Since b14 is not required on the table, it must be put there. I need to move it in a very specific order. I run the `unstack b7 b14`. Since, its goal is the stack on b21, but it cannot happen at once, I store it in the table.

Now I have to place `b21` on `b19`. I'm starting to get the flow now.  `b14`, which was taken from `b21`, will go on top of `b21`, and that goes on top of `b19`. I did not need to run `putdown` actions on these.  I'm now putting `b14` back on the `b21` and then stack the whole stack. I have to add those actions.

And that's the core. It's a dance of `unstack` and `putdown` to clear the way, then strategic `pickup` and `stack` to build the correct arrangements. This is how I will complete my plan.
