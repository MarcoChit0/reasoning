**A Detailed PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, let's break this down. The task is clear: I need to generate a complete PDDL plan for the `blocksworld-4ops` domain, given an instance and a feasible order of action landmarks. This is essentially about constructing a solution that both adheres to the specified landmark order and achieves the desired goal state in this classic block-stacking puzzle.

First, I've confirmed my understanding of the Blocksworld domain. It's all about moving blocks around with a robot arm, guided by the familiar predicates like `clear`, `on-table`, `on`, `arm-empty`, and `holding`. The four standard actions – `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack` – are the tools of the trade. I am very confident with how this works, as these are very simple to manage.

Next comes the analysis of the specific instance. The initial state is loaded, with details of blocks stacked on each other and blocks on the table. The goal state is a target configuration where the goal is to have specific blocks on top of others. The landmarks are critical; they define the core sequence of block-moving operations that must be incorporated into the plan.

Now, here's the core strategy. To satisfy the given order of landmarks, I'll need to interleave these landmark actions (which are the essential "stack" and "unstack" operations) with additional actions to build a workable plan. As an expert, I know that for blocksworld, a good approach here would be to "clear" the desired block (if it's not clear or has things on it) by unstacking blocks on top of it and putting them aside (on the table or some temporary stack if needed), then picking up and placing the desired block in its goal position. So I'll need to do the following:

1.  **Clear the way:** For each block that needs to be moved, I will first "clear" the goal block by unstacking any blocks on top of it and putting those temporary on the table.
2.  **Move the blocks:** Then, I can execute the "stack" landmark action to place the block where it should be.

The landmarks have to be implemented in an order such that after unstacking, the destination is clear and the goal state is achieved. It is an iterative process.

The plan generated, using this basic algorithm, will be as follows (showing my thought process):

*   I start with the first landmark, which is to unstack b25 from b3. Since this is a simple `on` relation, no intermediate unstack actions have to be considered. I check that the preconditions for this are met. Since they are, I add the action to the plan. However, to complete this landmark, I have to also place b25 somewhere, such as on a table. Therefore, I also add an intermediate `putdown` action.
*   I continue this logic for each unstack landmark. Once I arrive at the stacking, I realize that after all the unstack, most blocks are clear. Then, I can add intermediate `pickup` actions, followed by the `stack` landmark.
*   Once this is done, the goal state is achieved and the plan is complete.

The end result should be a fully detailed plan with any missing steps inserted!
