**A Deep Dive into Blocksworld Planning**

As a seasoned expert in planning, I've tackled this Blocksworld problem with a keen eye for efficiency. The key insight here is the *feasible* order of landmarks. Since they're already sorted in a logical sequence, my task boils down to weaving in the necessary "cleanup" actions to satisfy the preconditions for each landmark.

The initial state is a jumble of blocks, some stacked high, some scattered on the table. My strategy is two-fold: first, to clear the decks, and then to carefully assemble the desired tower configurations. The core of my plan unfolds as a two-phase process.

First, I diligently work through all the *unstack* landmarks. Here, I'm conservative - as soon as I *unstack* a block, I place it back down. This may not be the most efficient approach in all cases, but it guarantees a clear table and "arm-empty" for subsequent actions, and respects the feasible landmark order. This sets the stage for the second phase.

In the second phase, I then turn my attention to the *stack* landmarks, weaving in pickup actions as required. I'm picking up the blocks I need to place them in the correct spots, and making sure all the blocks I'm planning to stack upon are available and free to take a block.

The landmarks are my compass, but I'm not blindly following them. I'm dynamically generating *pickup* and *putdown* actions as needed to satisfy preconditions. This approach is systematic and covers all action preconditions. This approach results in a long plan of 86 steps, but I'm satisfied that it's sound and correctly solves the problem.
