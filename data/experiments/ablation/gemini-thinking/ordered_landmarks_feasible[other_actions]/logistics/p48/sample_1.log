**Logistics Planning: My Approach**

I'm tackling this logistics planning problem by constructing a PDDL plan for a given instance. My strategy hinges on understanding the domain, the initial state, the goals, and, crucially, the provided action landmarks. These landmarks are key because they represent actions that *must* be included in any valid solution. The "feasible order" means I have to incorporate these landmarks in the order they're provided, even if it requires adding intermediate actions.

My approach involves breaking down the problem into manageable steps:

1.  **Analyze the Structure:** I begin by analyzing the domain (logistics-strips), identifying the available actions (LOAD, UNLOAD, DRIVE, FLY) and objects (AIRPLANE, CITY, TRUCK, LOCATIONS, OBJS). The initial state describes the positions of packages, trucks, and the airplane, while the goal specifies the final destination of each package.

2.  **Landmark Interpretation:** These landmarks are the core. They're like guideposts in the planning process. The initial assumption was that they had to happen in the order given, but it turned out that it implied only relative order. So, I must ensure that these specific landmarks actions *with these specific parameters* appear in a plan, in a *logical* order with intermediate steps. This requires analyzing the relationship of each package's landmarks to determine *its* logical order of delivery.

3.  **Package-Centric Planning:** To structure the plan, I identified the packages that need to be moved and their associated landmarks. Then I created a plan for how that package would travel, based on its specific landmarks. This involved identifying the full route for a package, from pickup in the source city, to airplane transfer, to drop off at destination. These routes are now in temporal order.

4.  **Vehicle Movement Optimization:** In the past, I tried to optimize truck/airplane movement to pick up/drop off things, but that didn't guarantee all actions in my landmark list were included. Therefore, I need to do the planning sequentially. I do this by first identifying which packages are for truck travel and for airplane travel, and their landmarks for each stage. I created a high-level view (flight from which airport, trucks delivering) and added the precise actions.

The key to solving this is the correct interpretation of the landmark set. This approach builds the plan by ensuring each object's path uses its landmarks, and that these landmarks appear in their given order *with the specified parameters.* This ensures all given landmarks with the appropriate object details are met. Finally, a validation check must confirm the presence of all landmarks in their expected positions.
