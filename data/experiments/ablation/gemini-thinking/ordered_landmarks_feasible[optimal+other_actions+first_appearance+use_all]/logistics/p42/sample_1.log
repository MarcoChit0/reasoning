The goal is to generate a plan for the given PDDL instance, incorporating all provided action landmarks in their specified order of first appearance. The strategy involves processing the landmarks sequentially. For each landmark, the plan is extended with any necessary actions (truck drives, airplane flights, loads, unloads) to meet its preconditions. Once a landmark's preconditions are met, the landmark itself is added to the plan, and it's marked as fulfilled. If a landmark needs another action that is also a landmark but appears later in the provided list, that action is added to the plan as a regular action without marking it as fulfilled from the main landmark list. This ensures the "first appearance" order is maintained. After all landmarks are fulfilled, any remaining goal conditions are addressed by adding necessary actions.

Let's track the state of objects and vehicles throughout the planning process.

**Initial State:**
*   `a0`: at `l1-0`
*   `t0`: at `l0-0`
*   `t1`: at `l1-1`
*   `t2`: at `l2-2`
*   Packages (`p_at` / `p_in`):
    *   `p0`: at `l2-0`
    *   `p1`: at `l0-0`
    *   `p2`: at `l0-1`
    *   `p3`: at `l0-1`
    *   `p4`: at `l0-0`
    *   `p5`: at `l2-2`
    *   `p6`: at `l0-2`
    *   `p7`: at `l0-0`
    *   `p8`: at `l2-2`
    *   `p9`: at `l2-2` (Goal: `l2-2` - already met)
    *   `p10`: at `l2-1`
    *   `p11`: at `l1-2` (Goal: `l1-2` - already met)
    *   `p12`: at `l2-0` (Goal: `l2-0` - already met)
    *   `p13`: at `l0-0`
    *   `p14`: at `l0-1`
    *   `p15`: at `l0-2`
    *   `p16`: at `l0-1`
    *   `p17`: at `l0-0`
    *   `p18`: at `l2-2`
    *   `p19`: at `l2-0`
    *   `p20`: at `l2-1`
    *   `p21`: at `l2-0`
    *   `p22`: at `l0-0`

**Goal State (packages that need to move):**
*   `p0`: `l1-2`
*   `p1`: `l1-1`
*   `p2`: `l0-0`
*   `p3`: `l2-2`
*   `p4`: `l1-2`
*   `p5`: `l2-1`
*   `p6`: `l0-0`
*   `p7`: `l1-1`
*   `p8`: `l0-1`
*   `p10`: `l1-2`
*   `p13`: `l0-2`
*   `p14`: `l1-2`
*   `p15`: `l0-1`
*   `p16`: `l2-1`
*   `p17`: `l2-2`
*   `p18`: `l0-0`
*   `p19`: `l2-2`
*   `p20`: `l2-2`
*   `p21`: `l0-0`
*   `p22`: `l2-2`
