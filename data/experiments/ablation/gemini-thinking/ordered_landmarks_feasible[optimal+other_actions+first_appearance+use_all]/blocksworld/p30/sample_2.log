**Blocksworld Planning: A Deep Dive into Action Landmarks and Preconditions**

As a seasoned expert in planning, I've approached this blocksworld problem by meticulously dissecting the given information and crafting a PDDL plan. My initial strategy revolves around the provided domain, instance, and, most importantly, the action landmarks. These landmarks, although presented in a feasible order, often necessitate the insertion of auxiliary actions like `pickup` and `putdown`, or even block rearrangements, to fulfill crucial preconditions.

The crux of the challenge lies in achieving the desired goal state: all the specified `(on ?x ?y)` predicates must be satisfied. I embarked on a rigorous analysis, starting with the initial and goal states. I painstakingly examined the initial configuration of blocks and their relationships to the table, and the final stacked state.

**Deconstructing and Reconstructing: A Step-by-Step Approach**

My plan unfolds in a two-phase process: unstacking and stacking. In the unstacking phase, I meticulously follow the provided landmark sequence to dismantle the initial block towers.  For each `unstack` action, I ensure the appropriate block is clear and the arm is empty, resorting to `putdown` actions as needed. This phase effectively prepares the blocks for the final rearrangement, and the goal `(on b12 b17)` and `(on b21 b9)` are present in the goal state.

The stacking phase marks the core of the plan. I meticulously follow the order of the stacking landmarks, each of which specifies an `(on ?x ?y)` predicate to be achieved. To execute these stack actions, I insert a `pickup` action to pick up the block before placing it, making sure it follows the constraints. I will also perform re-stack actions to satisfy the goal. I keep track of the goal conditions, to ensure that the order is complete.

I also needed to handle the requirement that *all* blocks must be placed in goal configuration, including ones that are already in the goal configuration. I carefully tracked each block's state during the entire stack process.

**Landmark Respect: A Critical Consideration**

The real challenge lies in the nature of "feasible order" and action landmarks, and these stack operations that must *also* be performed to meet goal requirements.
I then carefully analyzed all stack actions needed to satisfy all goal configurations, and incorporated missing stack actions by following the given landmark sequence.
This carefully constructed plan satisfies all the preconditions for these stack operations, while also respecting the feasible order of given action landmarks.
My final, comprehensive plan consists of a sequence of unstack, putdown, pickup, and stack actions meticulously designed to meet the specified goal state.  This solution serves as a robust framework for successfully navigating this blocksworld puzzle.
