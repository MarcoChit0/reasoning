**The Road to Planning in Blocks World**

Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a PDDL plan for this blocksworld problem. I've got the domain, the instance (initial and goal states), and most importantly, the action landmarks.  The landmarks are like guideposts, a feasible sequence of actions that *must* appear in the plan, in the order given.  I've got a challenge though,  I also need to weave in the necessary `unstack`, `putdown`, `pickup`, and `stack` actions to ensure preconditions are met and all the goals are satisfied.

The initial state is a mess.  Blocks are stacked on top of each other, on the table, and my arm is empty.  The goal state is a carefully orchestrated arrangement.  It specifies where each block should end up.

My strategy? I'm going to simulate state changes action by action. I have to make sure each step satisfies all preconditions before I commit to it, then use the effects of that move to calculate the next step. It's like playing a game of chess, but I have to make sure the board is ready to allow me to make the required actions.

So the initial actions will be to unstack all the blocks and make them "clear" blocks on the table, with my arm empty. Then, I can start to follow the *stack* landmarks. Here I have to carefully insert the pick-ups so that all preconditions are met. This will be an important task, because if I pick up a block that is *holding* another block, and so it's not clear.

An important realization is that `(clear ?ob)` for a stack operation means that that block is now clear because it is on top, and the bottom block will not be clear. The Landmark strategy will be unstacking and stacking, and picking up, from the ground up, to form the final structure in the "goal" predicate.
I will have to ensure that all `stack` landmarks, in their correct order, are satisfied. I will ensure that there exists an intervening stack operation for `b14` and `b21` to make the overall state `(on b4 b14)`, `(on b14 b21)`.
It's going to be a long, but ultimately, rewarding journey to get this right.
