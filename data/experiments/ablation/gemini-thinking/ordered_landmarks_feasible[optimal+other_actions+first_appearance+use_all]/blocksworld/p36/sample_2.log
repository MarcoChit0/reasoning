**Generating a Plan for Blocksworld with Landmark Constraints**

My task is to create a valid plan for the `blocksworld-4ops` domain, given a specific instance of the problem and a feasible, ordered set of landmark actions. This essentially means I need to arrange blocks in a certain way, respecting the order in which specific actions must occur.

Here's how I'm approaching this:

1.  **Understand the Problem:** I'm dealing with the `blocksworld-4ops` domain, a classic problem where the goal is to stack blocks. I have a list of actions that *must* happen in the given order, the 'landmarks', and I need to figure out how to fit them into a full plan.

2.  **State Representation:** I maintain a detailed representation of the state (what's stacked on what, which blocks are clear, whether the arm is holding a block).  I start with the initial state and then update it as I add actions to the plan.

3.  **Landmark Processing:** I process each landmark action in the provided order. For each action, I need to make sure its preconditions are met (e.g., the blocks need to be in the right positions, the arm needs to be empty).

4.  **Helper Actions:** If a landmark action's preconditions aren't met, I add the necessary "helper" actions to the plan (e.g., `putdown` to free the arm, `pickup` to grab a block).

5.  **State Updates:** After adding an action (either the landmark itself or a helper action), I carefully update the state to reflect the action's effects.

6.  **The Plan:** The final plan is built by combining all the landmark actions and the necessary helper actions. It's a sequence that should take the world from the initial state to the goal state, and it should obey the given landmarks.

Specifically, the plan consists mostly of `unstack` and `stack` actions: first, all blocks are unstacked in the correct order to free up other blocks. Afterward, blocks will be moved by stacking. The initial state is such that if a block `b` is needed, then all blocks that are stacked on `b` are taken off with unstack. After that block `b` is free to stack and move to the goal location.

The critical part of this is to make sure I add the required `pickup` and `putdown` actions to make sure the state is always valid before executing any landmark. For instance, if the arm is holding a block that isn't supposed to be held, then I add a `putdown` action. If a block isn't held when it needs to be held for a `stack` action, then I will add a `pickup` action.

The key to a successful plan here is careful state management and making sure to only add those 'helper' actions when necessary, without redundant actions. Since the landmarks are a good set, I don't need to overthink the goal state reachability since the plan is a construction. The construction will always succeed.
