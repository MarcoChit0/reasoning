**Blocksworld Planner Implementation**

My task is to generate a PDDL plan for a Blocksworld problem, leveraging a given domain, instance, and a set of ordered action landmarks. The core challenge is to produce a valid plan that includes these landmarks in the specified order, while also ensuring that all preconditions for each action are met.

I've broken down the problem:

1.  **Goal Understanding:** I need to achieve a target configuration of blocks, defined by "on" predicates in the goal state.
2.  **Initial State Understanding:** I'm provided with the initial block arrangement ("on" and "on-table") and which blocks are "clear" (nothing is on top). The arm is initially "arm-empty."
3.  **Action Knowledge:** I know the four basic Blocksworld actions: "pickup," "putdown," "stack," and "unstack," along with their preconditions and effects.
4.  **Landmark Interpretation:** The landmarks represent key steps in a feasible plan. This means I should execute them in order. For each landmark, I'll need to check if its preconditions are met and insert any necessary intermediate actions.

**My Approach:**

I'll maintain a "current_state" data structure, including a dictionary of "on" relations, a set of blocks on the table, a set of clear blocks, and the current holding block. I'll represent the plan as a list of actions.

**Processing Landmarks:**

*   I'll iterate through each landmark, which is an action.
*   For each action, I check if its preconditions (e.g., "arm-empty," "clear," "on-table," "holding") are true in the current state.
*   If a precondition is not met, I'll insert appropriate intermediate actions to satisfy it.
    *   If I'm not "arm-empty," I'll insert "putdown."
    *   If a block "X" is not clear because something is on top, I'll insert "unstack" (and then "putdown" the unstacked block).
    *   If I need to be "holding," and I'm "arm-empty," I'll use "pickup."
*   After satisfying preconditions, I'll add the landmark action to the plan.
*   I'll apply the effects of the action to update my "current\_state" data.

**Key considerations**
*   **Clear and Table predicates** I understand that if these were in the initial state they are only explicitly true at the point and time in the world described.

I'll execute each landmark and see if the action is feasible. If it's not I'll try to find out where the action fails. 

Let's do this!
