**Navigating the Blocksworld Maze: A Planner's Journey**

My objective is to craft a PDDL plan that transforms the initial block configuration into the desired goal state, adhering meticulously to the provided action landmarks. I've broken down this complex puzzle into manageable steps, starting with a deep dive into the initial state.

The landscape is defined by the arrangement of blocks: some stacked, some on the table. My keen eye has revealed crucial constraints, primarily represented by the "clear" and "on-table" predicates.  "Clear" signifies a block is unburdened, ready for the grasp of the robotic arm. "On-table" means a block is resting on the table, but it doesn't necessarily mean it is clear.

The crux of the challenge lies in the landmark actions, which must be incorporated at their given order into any successful plan. These actions are the roadmap, but they require careful navigation. My strategy involves deconstructing the initial state by "unstacking" blocks in the prescribed order, ensuring each block is on the table, and then meticulously rebuilding the structures to reach the goal.

The initial unstacking actions are clear, but I must insert `putdown` actions after each `unstack` operation to put the block on the table before the next `unstack` action is possible. It's a dance of `unstack-putdown-repeat` to get everything to the table in a clear state.

Once the blocks are clear, the challenge shifts to the rebuilding phase. The order of the "stack" actions is crucial here as well. The provided landmarks define the stacking order, and I diligently follow them, inserting the necessary "pickup" actions to make each stack transformation valid.

This methodology guarantees that all landmark actions are included and performed in the right order.

The process has revealed a subtle issue: the final goal requires a stack not explicitly defined in the landmark set. I must add the necessary pick and stack actions to meet the requirements of any goal-achieving plan. Therefore, I've appended the missing action to the plan, ensuring the goal is fully realized. I must add (pickup b11) and (stack b11 b13) to build the (on b11 b13) structure.

Ultimately, by dissecting the initial state, respecting the landmarks, and carefully handling the preconditions and effects of each action, I've constructed a plan that should successfully achieve the goal state.
