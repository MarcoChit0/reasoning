**Expert PDDL Planning for Blocksworld**

Okay, so I need to craft a PDDL plan for this blocksworld problem. The core of it is ensuring those landmark actions show up in the given sequence. Sure, I can introduce other actions like `pickup` and `putdown` and reorder things where it makes sense to meet the preconditions, but the landmarks *must* stay in their pre-determined order. The whole goal is to arrange these blocks into a specific 'on' configuration, a particular stack of blocks on each other, right? I've got this complex initial configuration and a defined goal state, plus those ordered landmarks.

Alright, let's break this down. The landmarks usually suggest unstacking first, maybe moving stuff to the table, and then re-stacking. The initial state tells me which block is on which, and which blocks are already clear. The goals I have been given tell me which blocks I need to be on top of which at the end. I will use the *unstack* landmarks to get all the blocks on the table.

Unstacking will go something like this: If I need to unstack A from B, then I must pick up A, and put it on the table so I can get B from C, etc. When I get to a stacking landmark, I'll need to go back the other way, picking up things and putting them on top of other things. The plan is to get the blocks to the table, then stack the required blocks.

I'll execute the landmarks: `unstack b14 b28`, `unstack b28 b3`, `unstack b3 b22`, `unstack b22 b11`, `unstack b11 b18`, `unstack b18 b10`. Following that, I should see `(putdown)`, in which I put blocks on the table so I can see `arm-empty`. Next `unstack b29 b5`, `unstack b5 b4`, `unstack b4 b19`, and `unstack b19 b17`. This way, I get to use all landmark actions in a pre-defined way.

I'll follow the same procedure on all stacks for the next stacks, executing `pickup ?ob` and `stack ?ob ?underob`.

I will be careful to get all clear predicates true so that my plan makes logical sense. When I was done, I checked all the final states and they matched the goal predicates.
