**Pivoting from the Blocksworld:**

My immediate task is to devise a PDDL plan for this blocksworld scenario. I'm leveraging the provided domain and instance files, along with the ordered action landmarks. The ordering of these landmarks is crucial, and I'll be sure to incorporate them chronologically. However, I recognize the need to inject additional actions, such as `pickup`, `putdown`, `unstack`, and `stack`, to fulfill preconditions and maintain a logically consistent sequence.

**Deconstructing and Rebuilding:**

My process involves a meticulous breakdown of the initial and goal states. Initially, the scene presents as a collection of block towers and a sprinkling of blocks resting on the table. The goal state, conversely, outlines a complete rearrangement of these blocks. This requires a significant amount of unstacking and subsequent restacking.

**Landmark-Guided Pathfinding:**

The landmarks function as my roadmap. I will carefully consider each unstack landmark and will execute `putdown` immediately afterward. This way, I can clear the workspace to prevent obstacles to the subsequent actions. For the `pickup` landmarks, I simply have to execute `pickup`. For each stack landmark, I will use `unstack` and `putdown` actions to clear the desired target (the block that will become the base of a stack). I then employ `pickup` and `stack` to achieve the stack landmark.

**The Pivotal In-Between:**

The given landmarks don't explicitly require it, but there are instances where blocks will have to be restacked, in order for the plan to generate the needed results. For instance, the landmark to unstack b15 from b18 implies that it will have to be restacked somewhere, to generate the goal state. This requires careful inspection and integration into the action landmark sequence, but within this space I am able to construct a workable solution.

**Refinement and Validation:**

The complete plan is provided with the required actions to get from the initial state to the specified goal state. The plan is organized with the key landmarks in the provided sequence and a logical progression of pick-ups, putdowns, unstacking, and stacking to achieve the final configuration.
