**Initial Analysis and Plan Generation for Blocksworld Instance**

I'm tackling a blocksworld problem, where I need to devise a PDDL plan to rearrange blocks from an initial state to a goal state.  I've got the domain and instance files, plus a set of action landmarks provided in a specific order, and the critical piece is that I must incorporate these landmarks, which specify key actions, into my solution.

First, I scrutinized the starting and target configurations of the blocks to grasp the required rearrangement. My focus is on the `on` predicates that define the positions of the blocks and the `clear` predicate that indicates whether a block is free of anything on top. In blocksworld, a "clear" block means nothing is stacked upon it. My initial understanding was refined to accommodate the nuances of how `clear` works with blocks on the table. Based on the "on" relations, I confirmed the initial "clear" blocks: b10, b11, b13, b18, and b19.

The general strategy is to clear the top block on any stack, moving those blocks to the table, and then building the new stacks bottom-up. In the unstacking phase, it seems blocks on the table are not always "clear" initially because other blocks may be placed on top of them. However, for a given *unstack* action, I checked the preconditions and effects to maintain clarity.

I'm treating the landmark order as a critical constraint; I must stick to it while adding *intermediate* actions as needed to fulfill the preconditions, especially those related to `arm-empty` (the arm being free) and `clear`. The first phase of my plan will involve unstacking all blocks that are currently on top of others, so that those top blocks are clear. Intermediate `putdown` actions make the arm empty, so I can continue with the next *unstack* action. This process creates a intermediate state where every block from b1-b22 is on the table, clear, and the arm is empty.

During the building phase, I iterate through *pickup* and *stack* landmarks. If the arm is busy, I put the object down.

However, I've hit a tricky situation within the set of landmarks, specifically in Stack D, involving blocks b4, b14, b19, and b21. This stack is supposed to be built as `b19 -> b21 -> b14 -> b4`. The landmarks are `(stack b21 b19)`, `(stack b4 b14)`, `(stack b14 b21)`. Based on these actions, building the Stack D is impossible in the given order.

To resolve this issue, I reinterpreted the meaning of "feasible order." I assume it means that while actions are executed in the landmark order, intermediate actions are allowed. Based on that interpretation, to solve the problem, the plan must include some temporary actions which are: unstack b4 from b14, place b4 on the table, perform pickup b14 and do all stack actions from the landmark set, and finally, re-place b4 on b14. These unstack and putdown actions are not landmarks, but they make it possible to generate an *actual* plan for this task. I need to handle cases where a `stack` action from the goal must be achieved again, and I may have a solution.
