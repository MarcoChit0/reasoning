**Blocksworld Plan Generation - Insights & Strategy**

Alright, let's break this down. The challenge here is to create a PDDL plan for a blocksworld problem. I'm given the domain (the rules), the instance (the initial state and goal), and importantly, action landmarks. These landmarks are crucial; they dictate the order of key actions I *must* include. The goal is to stack blocks in a specific configuration, which, from my experience, means I'll be working with a lot of `unstack`, `pickup`, `putdown`, and `stack` actions.

My approach is to treat the landmarks as signposts, guiding the plan while making sure I satisfy the requirements for each action. The key is that the landmarks are provided in a feasible order, so the plan must respect that sequence.

Initially, I looked at the block configuration. A large number of blocks were stacked high. My initial step was to simulate the state changes using these landmarks, paying close attention to the preconditions. For instance, an `unstack` requires `(on ?x ?y) (clear ?x) (arm-empty)`. I quickly realized that I'd need to insert `putdown` actions to handle the `arm-empty` constraint. It essentially becomes a pattern of `unstack -> putdown -> unstack`, moving blocks to the table to clear the path. The "clear" status of blocks is also critical: initially clear blocks become not clear. `putdown` makes things clear.

Next, I worked through the initial sequence of `unstack` and `putdown` steps. This had a very predictable outcome: all blocks were on the table. Following this, I tackled the *stacking* sequence, ensuring to introduce pickup actions.

I noticed a key pattern here â€“ to perform `(stack x y)`, I needed `(clear y)` and `(holding x)`. So I added `(pickup x)` actions prior to stack actions. This forms a `pickup -> stack` pattern.

A critical point came up when I rechecked and carefully compared the landmarks. There was the goal `(on b18 b23)` but the landmarks didn't explicitly create it. I had to look closely at the "feasible order" property of the landmarks.  I needed to create a plan that worked around the landmarks to achieve my goal. The landmarks included `(stack b14 b18)` and `(stack b23 b20)`,  I found that I needed to insert the action `(stack b18 b23)` in order to satisfy the overall goal, even if it wasn't specified as a landmark.

So, I re-adjusted my plan by adding intermediate `(pickup b18)` and `(stack b18 b23)` calls to achieve the intended goal state, without violating the *given* landmark sequence.
