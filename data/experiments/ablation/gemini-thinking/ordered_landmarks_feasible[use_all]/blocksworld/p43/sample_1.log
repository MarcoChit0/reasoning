**Blocksworld Plan Generation Process**

My primary objective is to develop a valid PDDL plan for the given blocksworld scenario. I'm focusing on crafting this plan by following the provided action landmarks in their given sequence. This involves carefully ensuring that each landmark's preconditions are met before its execution and keeping track of the state transitions.

Here's how I'm approaching this:

1.  **State Assessment:** First, I'm carefully analyzing the initial state, identifying the relationships between blocks, their positions (on-table, on), and which blocks are clear (i.e., nothing is on them). The final state, or goal state, is then examined in order to construct the desired configuration.

2.  **Landmark-Driven Execution:** For each action landmark, I rigorously ensure its preconditions are satisfied. If any preconditions are unmet, I insert preceding actions, primarily "pickup," "putdown," "unstack," and "stack" actions, to bridge the gap. Then, I update the current state to reflect the effect of the landmark.

3.  **State Tracking:** I'm meticulously tracking key predicates, notably `clear`, `holding`, `arm-empty`, `on`, and `on-table`, throughout the plan construction process. This ensures that the state transitions align with each action's pre- and postconditions.

**Plan Construction**

I started with the initial state and processed the action landmarks. For each landmark, I've constructed the necessary putdown or pickup operations where necessary.

The final plan is structured as follows. Firstly all the blocks were made on-table and clear in preparation for the stacks. Then, new blocks were constructed by placing each clear block that has been picked up on top of its respective lower block:

1. **Unstacking:** Repeated "putdown" and "unstack" operations. This ensures that preconditions for subsequent stack actions are met.
2. **Stacking:** Repeated "pickup", and "stack" operations.
I performed a double-check to verify preconditions for each "pickup" and "stack" operation. The logic appears sound, with an assurance that each `pickup` and `stack` has correct state values for the preconditions. The resulting plan is as described in the previous section.

**Plan Validation**

Upon completion, I verified the plan against the goal state, confirming that all desired `on` relations are correctly established, and the arm is empty, which confirms the validity of the constructed plan.
