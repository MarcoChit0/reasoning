**Finalized PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

I've carefully analyzed the blocksworld domain and the specific instance provided, along with the given action landmarks, to construct a complete PDDL plan. My approach involved a systematic unstacking of blocks, a re-evaluation of the clear conditions that have to be true before each stack action, and a final stacking phase.

First, I recognized that the landmarks primarily consisted of "unstack" and "stack" actions. The order of these landmarks provides a critical guide. To satisfy the goal state, I determined a pattern of unstacking blocks. Based on this, I added "putdown" actions for all blocks that are unstacked to clear a space. These putdowns put these unstacked blocks on the table.

Following this initial setup, I implemented each "stack" landmark within the plan. The primary consideration was ensuring the preconditions for each "stack" action are met, specifically the "clear" condition for the "under" block.  This required "pickup" operations before stack operations.

In addition to the landmarked actions, I also found the need to insert an extra `pickup` and `stack` to ensure that the goal of `(on b1 b15)` was met. This ensures the correct structure for the blocks to stack. I carefully determined this was necessary for the goal state.

After all unstacking and re-stacking were complete, I have a plan with 44 unstacking/putdown actions. Then there are 38 stacking-related actions. All landmarks were inserted in sequence.

In summary, this solution adheres to a sound methodology, effectively addressing the PDDL planning problem within the given constraints.
