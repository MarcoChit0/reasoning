**A Detailed PDDL Plan for the Blocksworld Instance**

Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a PDDL plan for this Blocksworld problem, ensuring it reaches the specified goal state while incorporating all given action landmarks in their predefined order. I've got the domain, the initial state, the goal state, and those crucial action landmarks. My strategy? Carefully integrate those landmarks into a workable plan.

First, I examined the initial state, grasping the starting configuration of the blocks and identifying clear blocks. Then, I scrutinized the goal state, pinpointing the final arrangement I need to achieve. A critical point: the landmark sequence suggests a feasible order. I need to make sure the auxiliary actions don't mess it up!

Now, the plan: I've divided this into unstacking and stacking phases. The landmarks guide the process.

**Unstacking Phase:** I start by carefully unstacking everything. Before each landmark `unstack` action, I need to ensure the `clear` and `arm-empty` preconditions are satisfied. Any block that prevents this, I `putdown`.

**Key Observation:** All blocks that were initially stacked become clear. All are on the table and I have an arm-empty to stack!

**Stacking Phase:** Now, it's time to build the goal state. I'll follow the provided stacking landmarks in order. BUT, here's a wrinkle: I identified a crucial goal `(on b15 b18)` that isn't a landmark. I must insert the auxiliary action `(stack b15 b18)` at the *right* place.

I meticulously traced the landmarks. The current landmarks need:
*   (on b15 b18) *and* (on b9 b15)

So I have to put b15 on b18 and then the landmark `(stack b9 b15)`

I must insert an auxiliary `(stack b15 b18)` immediately after b18 is placed on the table, to fulfill the (clear b18) (holding b15) preconditions.

Once I ensure this, I then build up the stacks as dictated by the remaining stacking landmarks, and *voil√†*! I've confirmed that the plan achieves the goal by meeting all target state predicates. The `(stack b15 b18)` step is the key addition to the landmark sequence and this ensures all intermediate states also respect the domain's rules. I verified the whole plan by tracking the state after each action, checking if all goal conditions are true at the end. The final plan? It's complete, feasible, and compliant with the PDDL requirements.
