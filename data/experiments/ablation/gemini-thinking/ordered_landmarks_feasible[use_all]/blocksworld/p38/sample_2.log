**Blocksworld Planning: A Landmark-Guided Approach**

My primary goal is to generate a PDDL plan for a given Blocksworld instance. I will use the provided domain, instance data, and critical action "landmarks" as a guide. The landmarks are strategically ordered, which indicates they're part of a solution sequence.  I need to add actions like `pickup`, `putdown`, `unstack`, and `stack` to ensure the preconditions of landmarks and other solution steps are satisfied.

1.  **Understanding the Problem:** I first break down the goal state, which requires specific blocks to be stacked on others and implicitly assumes the arm is empty.
2.  **State Analysis:**  I carefully analyze the initial state, recording block positions (as `on` relations), the `arm-empty` state, blocks clear on top of stacks, and those on the table (`on-table`).
3.  **Landmark Processing:** The plan's core is the landmark actions.  I'll attempt to execute these in the given order, using a "table-clearing-then-stacking" strategy.

To create the plan, I track the current state and build actions to reach each landmark action.  If I am holding a block when I have to `unstack`, I put it on the table. When I need to stack an object, I move an empty arm and then pick it up.  To put a block on the table (usually for stack), my strategy picks it up first.  I am confident that the landmark order guides a feasible, step-by-step solution.

I then went through each landmark, keeping track of the state, noting what needed to be in the agent's hand, and where blocks needed to be moved. The plan begins by unstacking every block from the initial configuration. After unstacking, the plan picks up and stacks blocks, one by one. I added additional actions to place blocks in place (the initial plan was incomplete), and then I added the stack action. All final configurations should match the goal, and it follows the clear landmarks.
