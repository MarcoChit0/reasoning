The provided action landmarks present a challenge due to their "feasible order" constraint. Specifically, for several packages (e.g., `p11`, `p23`, `p14`, `p16`, `p19`), a `load-truck` landmark action in one city (e.g., `(load-truck p11 t2 l2-0)`) appears earlier in the landmark list than the necessary preceding actions for the same package to reach that city (e.g., `(load-truck p11 t1 l1-2)`). This creates a logical contradiction if interpreted strictly, as an object cannot be at an intermediate destination without having completed earlier transport steps.

To adhere to the problem statement "there is at least one valid plan that could be built following the action landmarks order," I've adopted the following interpretation:
1.  All actions listed in the `action-landmarks-set` must appear in the plan *in the exact order they are given*.
2.  Any action (including `LOAD-TRUCK`, `UNLOAD-TRUCK`, `LOAD-AIRPLANE`, `UNLOAD-AIRPLANE`, `DRIVE-TRUCK`, `FLY-AIRPLANE`) can be used as a non-landmark action to fulfill preconditions for an upcoming landmark. If a non-landmark action happens to have the exact parameters of a landmark action that appears *later* in the list, it is considered a distinct, non-landmark instance for the purpose of pre-conditioning. When the actual landmark action from the list is encountered, it is then executed. This leads to a plan that may appear redundant or inefficient, with objects moving back and forth, but it is the only way to satisfy the strict ordering of the given landmarks.

This approach ensures that the "feasible order" is strictly followed, and all landmarks are present, even if it implies a very specific and non-optimal journey for some packages.
