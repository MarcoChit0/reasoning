The plan below strictly adheres to the given order of action landmarks, inserting all necessary intermediate actions (truck movements, airplane flights, intermediate load/unload actions) to ensure that each landmark's preconditions are met when it is encountered in the sequence. This approach may result in a non-optimal or seemingly circuitous path for some packages (e.g., packages being moved to a location, then moved back, and then moved again to satisfy the landmark ordering), but it is the only way to conform to the strong constraint that the landmarks are provided in a *feasible order* and *must be followed*.
