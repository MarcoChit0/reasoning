**The Logic of Blocksworld Planning**

Alright, let's break this down. My task is to generate a PDDL plan for the `blocksworld` problem, given the initial state, the goal state, and a set of action landmarks that must be followed in their first appearance.  The crux of this is respecting the *order* of the landmarks while arriving at the correct stacking.

First, I need to *understand the situation*. I have a messy initial state with blocks stacked in various ways, and a clear, desired goal: specific blocks stacked on top of others in a particular configuration. The landmarks hint at the overall approach. It's a "clear the table and then build" kind of problem.

The initial state is my starting point, and I have to translate it to the goal. It is essentially analyzing `clear` and `on` predicates and working towards making the initial state be the final state. I have to look at initial state, goal state and the list of actions that I can perform and generate an execution plan from it.

The plan will primarily follow an approach where blocks are unstacked to clear the workspace. These unstacked blocks will need to go somewhere—the table—to clear other blocks as per the plan. I will need to pick up a block that is in the way to achieve a stack, which makes the arm not empty. I have to plan for a strategy to unstacking blocks to clear the workspace.

My strategy involves taking those landmark hints seriously. "Unstack" actions indicate a clearing phase, followed by "stack" actions to build the towers. The landmarks will guide the actions. The order must be respected. I will try to respect the order of the actions, where `unstack` is followed by blocks to be "putdown" on the table. Later when all blocks are clear on the table, I will build towers.

So, here's how I envision it: I'll go through the landmarks, *respecting their order*. I am going to unstack blocks and put them down on the table, and after all blocks are unstacked, I can stack them accordingly. The plan will be constructed step by step, following the landmarks. I have to check the preconditions and effects of each action to ensure everything is valid.  I need to add actions to pick blocks up. The stack action also requires (clear b), and hence blocks on the table.

The process is:

1. Unstack the blocks that were on top of those blocks that need to be stacked in the goal state. I have to ensure that all `clear` predicates are satisfied to allow `unstack` or stack operations.
2. Put the picked-up blocks to the table, and make sure that a block is `on-table` and `clear` to avoid conflicts.
3. Once all necessary `unstack` and `putdown` actions are done, pick up a block from the table (i.e. if it is `clear` and `on-table`) and ensure that it is able to perform the action `(stack x y)`.

I must add `pickup` actions, `putdown` actions in-between unstack and stack to make sure the state is valid during the execution. I have to ensure that (holding arm) is true before the putdown step. I have to ensure that the preconditions for each landmark are met.

I can insert non-landmark actions, or re-use landmarks later.

This structured approach should lead to a valid plan that respects the landmark order.
