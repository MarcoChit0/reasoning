**Plan Synthesis for Blocksworld**

My task is to construct a PDDL plan for a given blocksworld instance.  I'm leveraging my expertise in automated planning to guide this process. The core of my approach involves utilizing the provided domain, instance specifications, and a crucial set of "action landmarks." These landmarks represent essential actions that *must* be included in any valid solution.  My strategy is to build a plan that incorporates these landmarks in their specified order, ensuring that I achieve a valid plan structure.

First, I break down the problem details, including the initial and goal states, and all object instances. The landmarks are critical. I see that they have a particular order. I take the first unstack landmark, and ensure that the action can be applied in the current state (I'm an expert in plan construction, so this will be efficient). Then, when the action is no longer needed, I `putdown` the block. When I encounter a `stack` landmark, I ensure that the target block is clear. If a block must be placed on another in the final solution, it is first `unstacked` from its intermediate position.

A significant challenge is the interpretation of the "feasible order" of these landmarks. It means there's a plan, but there are added steps needed to achieve the plan. For instance, the goal requires a specific arrangement that may not be directly achievable through the landmarks. I must make sure that intermediate goals (for example, (on b15 b18) during this plan) are achieved as an intermediate step.

After careful scrutiny, I determined that, in this instance, there's a requirement of one intermediate goal (on b15 b18). In short, the plan requires an auxiliary `stack` action not directly specified by the landmark set to ensure the final goal state.  I can confidently state that I created a plan that aligns with the given constraints and is logically sound.
