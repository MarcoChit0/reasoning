**Initial Plan Construction for a Blocksworld Problem**

My goal is to generate a PDDL plan for a blocksworld problem, aiming to achieve a specific goal state while adhering to a given sequence of actions called "landmarks." The landmarks are presented in a feasible order, meaning there exists at least one valid plan that incorporates them in that sequence. I'm focusing on crafting a plan that respects this order, potentially adding "helper" actions like `putdown`, `pickup` as needed. The problem involves manipulating blocks on a table, creating stacks of blocks based on a goal state defined by an "on" relation between blocks.

Initially, I broke down the problem into three key phases. First, an initial understanding and analysis of the goal state is done. It requires arranging a group of blocks in specific configurations, mainly by moving blocks and restacking them. Next, the current situation and the starting point (initial state) are closely inspected. In my case, this involves an empty arm, various blocks being stacked, some on the table, and identifying what blocks are clear (meaning they have nothing on top of them), along with a few clear predicates supplied initially. Last, an analysis of the landmarks and the various unstack and stack actions.

My strategy involves processing the landmarks in their given sequence, adding support actions when necessary. In the first phase, I will go through the `unstack` landmarks by looking at each one, and if the arm is not empty, perform a `putdown` of the held block to free the arm, thus, satisfying the necessary precondition for `arm-empty`. After putting down the block, I can then perform the `unstack` landmark, which then places a block in the hand (e.g., `holding ?block`). I keep repeating this process with each landmark.

Following this, I proceed to use the `stack` landmarks, placing the blocks in the desired positions and forming the target configurations. At the start of the `stack` landmarks, I make sure to pick up the stack's base, then the target `on` predicate. I also have to handle any "conflicts". The process also involved generating a list of `clear` predicates, which are crucial for `unstack` and `stack` action preconditions.

The most challenging part was dealing with a conflict between the goal `(on b1 b15)` (meaning block b1 is on block b15) and a landmark `(stack b15 b4)`. I realized that this required putting block b1 *before* the landmark action.

In essence, I need to execute `unstack` operations to clear blocks, handle any putdowns needed to satisfy preconditions, and then arrange the stacks, using the pickup actions where needed. It needs to be implemented in a careful way, so as to achieve the desired goals. In addition to all the stack operations, I need to make sure to create the plan in a way that the landmark order is maintained for each instance of the landmark.
