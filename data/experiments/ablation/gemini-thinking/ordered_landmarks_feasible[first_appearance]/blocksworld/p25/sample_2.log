**Finalized PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, after meticulously reviewing the instance, the goal, and the landmark actions, I've constructed a PDDL plan that should solve this blocksworld puzzle. The primary challenge here was managing the dependencies between the landmark actions, specifically their order of *first* appearance, while still achieving the desired goal state.

First, I identified that the initial state requires a complete breakdown of all stacks. Therefore, the plan starts with a series of `unstack` actions. As the arm is by default empty, the plan intersperses `putdown` actions to free it up whenever a block is picked up and a `unstack` or `pickup` landmark cannot be executed. This clears the workspace.

After the unstacking phase, the plan then builds the goal stacks using the given landmarks in their specified order of first appearance. This involved adding `pickup` actions before `stack` landmarks and non-landmark actions, especially to complete specific stacks. These steps ensure that blocks end up in the intended places and stacks are built correctly.

In essence, I've broken the plan into three key steps: unstack, stack, and any extra `pickup` or `stack` steps to fulfill landmark constraints or the goal state.
