**Plan Generation for Blocksworld Instance**

Alright, let's break down how I'm thinking about this. The core task is to create a plan in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the blocksworld. The goal is a specific configuration of blocks, described by these `(on ...)` predicates, like "block b1 must be on block b3". I need to get there from the initial state of the blocks world, making sure to follow a list of actions or "landmarks" provided.

My strategy is to stick closely to the landmark order. Since these are given in a specific sequence, the plan should build on them. These landmarks give me a structured guide to follow.

The initial state reveals a bunch of blocks stacked on each other and some on the table. The "clear table" strategy comes to mind first. It looks like many blocks need to be moved around. This means I'll likely need to clear the way for most of the goal positions. I also have to consider each landmark as either a "pickup" a "stack", or "unstack". If a block is under another one, then a putdown will be needed for the arm.

This means before stacking something on another block, I must make sure that block is clear. And, for `unstack`, I need an empty arm. So, the first part of the plan focuses on unstacks and corresponding putdowns. This puts all blocks on the table, clear and ready to move. This strategy is also implied by all unstack landmarks given at the beginning.

In the second part, I execute the stack landmarks as they are given, one by one.  For each stack, I check if the block to be stacked is clear and on the table. If not, I insert the needed "pickup" action to satisfy the `holding` precondition. I execute this process for all the blocks to achieve the goal state. So, it's really the two parts: clearing the table and stacking them up. The initial landmark structure suggests the first part: clearing, and that's it!

I've already created the full PDDL plan based on this logic, carefully following the landmark order and state changes to generate a plan that gets the blocksworld instance to its target goal state, so that when a validator is run on it, this should validate.
