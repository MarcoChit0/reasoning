**Initial Plan Construction for Blocksworld Instance**

Okay, I've got the task laid out. I need to generate a PDDL plan for this `blocksworld` instance, using the provided domain, the given initial state, and those crucial action landmarks. The landmarks are in a feasible order, which simplifies things. The general approach I'll take is to break down existing stacks with `unstack` actions, freeing up blocks, and then use `pickup` and `stack` actions to construct the new stack configurations, all while respecting the landmark order. This is a standard approach in blocksworld.

I'm starting by analyzing the problem domain. The key predicates are `clear`, `on-table`, `arm-empty`, `holding`, and `on`. The actions are the standard `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`. The challenge here is the number of blocks and the complex goal state.

Breaking it down, I see the initial state is a typical tower of blocks, with the arm empty. The goal state is a bit more complicated, representing a rearrangement of those blocks. The given action landmarks are the key to the solution. The landmarks are mostly unstack actions, then stack, which suggest an initial dismantling, followed by construction. This seems correct.

I'm starting with the initial state and going through the sequence. For any `unstack` where the top block isn't immediately used in a stack landmark, I will need to use `putdown` to ensure `arm-empty`.  The current strategy is to maintain the state after each step. Since the unstack operations require `arm-empty` and `clear` for both the top and the bottom block of a stack, and the initial state only had `clear` for the top blocks of some stacks, I'll need to interleave `putdown` actions to satisfy the conditions as I work through the `unstack` actions. The sequence will be unstack, putdown, unstack, putdown, and so on.

The plan will be a long one. After a lot of `unstack` and `putdown`, I'll start with the `pickup` and `stack` sequence.
Each `stack` will require `clear` (the block it rests on must be clear) and, of course, that the arm is `holding` a block. Each `pickup` action will take place to satisfy that particular landmark.

Now, let's step through each action and derive the full plan...
