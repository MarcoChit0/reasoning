**Final PDDL Plan for the Blocksworld Instance**

Okay, here's the plan I've constructed. The challenge was a standard blocksworld problem with a twist: I had to respect specific "landmark" actions and ensure I hit all the goal states.  I started by analyzing the initial state, the goal state, the actions available (pickup, putdown, stack, unstack), and the provided landmark actions.

The strategy I landed on, which I believe is pretty typical for blocksworld problems, is to essentially "flatten" the initial configuration by unstacking everything. This means I had to go through a long sequence of unstacking actions, putting blocks on the table. Each unstack needed a corresponding putdown if the arm was holding a block.

Then, based on the landmarks, I meticulously built the target stacks, bottom-up, one block at a time. The landmarks acted as constraints, and I had to insert additional actions to bridge gaps in the landmark set, specifically adding "(stack b12 b17)" and "(stack b21 b9)" to meet all the goal conditions.

The generated plan begins with the unstacking phase to free up blocks for manipulation and moves into a stacking phase, constructing towers from their bases. Each stacking step takes a block from the table (or a current position) and places it on another block, while keeping the landmark actions' order in mind.  It's a "flatten everything then build" plan.
