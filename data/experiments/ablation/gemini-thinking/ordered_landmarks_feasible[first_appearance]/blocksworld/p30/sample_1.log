**A Detailed PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, here's my plan to tackle this blocksworld puzzle. The goal is to generate a valid PDDL plan that gets us from the initial block arrangement to the desired final configuration. I have the domain and instance files, along with an ordered set of "landmarks" â€“ key actions that must appear in the final plan, and in the *same* order.

First, I need to really *understand* the starting and finishing states. I'm looking at the initial arrangement of blocks, figuring out which blocks are sitting on tables, which are clear, and which are stacked on top of each other. Then, I meticulously examine the goal state: where each block needs to *end up*. I've got a lot of "on" predicates, which is a good indicator of the problem's complexity.

Next up, the landmarks. These are my guiding lights, the necessary steps. Most of them are 'unstack' actions, which makes sense for clearing out blocks to make space to build the goal stacks. My intuition here tells me I'll need to interleave 'putdown' actions to ensure the arm remains empty, and 'pickup' actions to grab blocks I need.

My plan begins by going through each landmark and figuring out a plan for that landmark. For each landmark, I'll simulate the state changes and add the required `putdown` and `pickup` actions as needed. Basically, if I must `unstack b2 b7`, I can add a `putdown b2` to make the arm empty.

I'm starting by ensuring all required unstack actions will be done, resulting in all specified blocks ending on the table.
Then, I'll systematically stack them in the target config. I have to be careful here because the landmarks are *ordered*. I need to ensure they appear in the final plan in this order, or at least that the first instance of each is in the correct place. To accomplish this, I must include *additional* stacking steps.

I've determined I needed additional steps, like re-stacking b12 b17. This, and other missing actions like re-stacking b21 b9, are necessary and must be inserted into the plan.

I have a plan that ensures all required unstacking operations are done. All required blocks are then placed on the table, clear and available. Next, the stack operations build on each other to reach the target state. I carefully verify that the sequence of 'clear' and 'on' predicates aligns with the plan's actions. I must verify the arm is empty, and the goal stack configurations are maintained or re-established. 

By carefully checking, the final plan has 80 steps, and ensures the problem is solved in a valid way, and all preconditions and postconditions are fulfilled.
