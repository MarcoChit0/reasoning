**A Deep Dive into Blocksworld Planning**

Alright, let's break this down. The objective here is to craft a PDDL plan for a classic blocksworld problem, given an initial setup, a desired final configuration, and a list of crucial action landmarks. The key is to generate a valid plan that not only includes all the landmarks but also ensures the final goal state is met.

First, I need to thoroughly understand the problem's starting point: the initial arrangement of blocks. This includes whether my arm is free, the blocks on the table, and the configuration of any stacked blocks.

Next, I look at the target configuration, which dictates the final state. This will guide my actions and help verify if the plan successfully achieves the desired layout.

Here comes the interesting part: the "action landmarks." These are essentially key stepping stones that *must* be included in the final plan. They primarily involve "unstack" actions to break down existing stacks, followed by "stack" actions to build new ones.

Based on the provided landmarks and state, it appears I'll need a "clear everything, then build" approach. So, I will unstack all objects and place them on the table using the `putdown` operation.

However, a subtle issue arises: the goal state includes relations such as "(on b12 b17)" and "(on b21 b9)," which are already true in the initial state and are also part of the desired goal.

Now, a critical point emerges. Landmarks, in general, are extracted from the delete-relaxed planning graph. In this graph, there is never a "delete" of an already true fact, so a consistent plan should exist if the landmarks are valid. But in the true PDDL, the `unstack` action will *delete* the on relation. So, I will have to ensure that these relations are *re-established* if they get broken in the process.

This implies inserting extra `stack` actions that aren't explicitly listed but are necessary to ensure the goal state. I then need to carefully verify that these inserted actions do not create any conflicts.

After a deep analysis of the problem, I will insert the missing actions and construct a complete PDDL plan using both the landmarks and necessary supporting actions, such as picking up an object before stacking it.
