**Plan Generation: A Detailed Breakdown**

Alright, let's craft a PDDL plan for this blocksworld puzzle. The objective is to achieve a specific set of "on" relationships between the blocks, and I'm equipped with a domain, instance, and a sequence of crucial "landmarks" (helpful action hints). My strategy involves a meticulous step-by-step approach.

I'll start by analyzing the initial state, noting the current configuration of blocks and the state of the robot arm. Then, I'll systematically process each landmark. For each landmark, I'll verify if its preconditions are already met. If not (and this is the common scenario), I'll determine the necessary intermediate actions (pickup, putdown, unstack, stack) needed to satisfy those preconditions *before* executing the landmark itself. A key consideration here is ensuring that blocks are clear (have nothing on top of them) when they need to be picked up or stacked. I'll use those helpful actions to prepare my intermediate states for the landmarks.

Now, some goals are already "true" in the initial setup, but the plan requires them to be moved and stacked again, such as with blocks B2, B6 and B19.

Here's how this unfolds, considering the current state and goal predicates:

I'm systematically going through the landmarks and, whenever a landmark's preconditions aren't met, I'll create a plan to execute actions that will fulfill those preconditions.
For some initial states, some goals are already true, but still I need to take those blocks and stack them again in the way as per the landmarks to satisfy the intermediate state.

I'm keeping careful track of the "arm-empty", "holding", "clear", "on-table", and "on" predicates, modifying them with the proper "pickup" and "putdown" actions.

**In summary:** The core of the plan involves unstacking blocks to clear the way, putting them down to free up the arm, and then restacking them according to the landmark sequence. The plan is complete!
