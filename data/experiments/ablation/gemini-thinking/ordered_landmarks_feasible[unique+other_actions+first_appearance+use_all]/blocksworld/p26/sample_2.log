**Refined Planning Process for Blocksworld-4ops**

As an expert in the field, I understand the challenge: generate a PDDL plan for the `blocksworld-4ops` domain, given an instance with a set of action landmarks in a feasible order. My approach is to meticulously analyze the problem, construct the plan step-by-step, and ensure it meets all criteria.

Firstly, I define the goal state by dissecting the desired `on` relations between blocks. I then evaluate the initial state, visualizing the stacks and identifying clear blocks. This visualization is crucial for understanding the current arrangement and for planning the manipulations.

The heart of the plan lies in efficiently utilizing the action landmarks. I recognize these landmarks are in a feasible, but not necessarily complete, order. My strategy involves two key phases: unstacking and stacking. In the unstacking phase, I will insert `putdown` actions to handle `holding` predicates. The stacking phase includes all the landmark `stack` actions and *one new action* to construct the missing partial stack (to achieve (on b15 b18) where the goal has (on b15 b18)).

This systematic approach will produce a correct and efficient plan.
