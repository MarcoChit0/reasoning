**A Detailed PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, let's craft a plan for this blocksworld instance.  We're given the domain, instance details, and crucial "landmarks," which are actions we *must* incorporate, in order, into our final plan. The core problem is to rearrange blocks to match a specific "on" configuration.

Here's my thought process:

1.  **Grasp the Goal:** Our mission is to transform the initial block arrangement into the target state defined by those `on` relationships.

2.  **Analyze the Starting Point:** The initial state is a bit of a mess: blocks are stacked on each other and the table.

3.  **Analyze the Target State:** The goal state defines a new set of `on` relationships.  It's a jumble of towers.

4.  **Devise a Strategy:** The landmarks hint at a strategy: we'll likely *unstack* most blocks to clear the table, then *stack* them back up in the desired configuration.

    *   For each *unstack* action, we must ensure the arm is empty and the bottom block is clear. If these preconditions aren't met, we'll need to insert extra actions. This is essentially clearing the board.
    *   For each *stack* action, we need a block in the arm to be clear and above another block. We need to *pickup* or *unstack* to do it.

Now, let's step through the landmarks and build the plan iteratively. I'll add the necessary "helper" actions as we go.

*   I'll start by systematically unstacking the blocks. Each time I unstack I'll need to immediately put the block back on the table.
*   Once the table is cleared I'll then move into the 'pickup and stack' portion to build the towers as needed. This will be the longest portion.
*   The goal state must be achieved by our plan.
*   Then will will need to insert the pickup actions to correctly order the stacks.

The plan will be a sequence of actions, including *unstack*, *putdown*, *pickup*, and *stack* steps, ensuring the preconditions of each action are satisfied.
* Once the unstack actions are done, a stacking phase will begin.
* The pickup actions will be inserted to meet the holding requirement, such that the stacking phase is ready to go.
* The landmarks are accounted for in each phase.
