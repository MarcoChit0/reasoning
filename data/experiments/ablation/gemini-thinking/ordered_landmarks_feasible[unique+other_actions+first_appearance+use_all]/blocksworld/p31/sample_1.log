**Generating a PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

I'm tackling a Blocksworld problem with a specific initial state, goal state, and a helpful set of action landmarks. My strategy is straightforward: first, I'll unstack any blocks that are misplaced or blocking others. Then, I'll put those blocks on the table if they aren't directly stackable. Finally, I'll use the landmark order to stack the blocks into the desired goal configuration.

To implement this, I'll analyze the initial and goal states, and then work through the landmark actions. I'll need to carefully track the `clear`, `on-table`, `holding`, `arm-empty`, and `on` predicates to ensure the preconditions of each action are met. Intermediate "putdown" actions will be added where necessary to make sure I can pick up and stack blocks correctly.

My plan starts with unstacking blocks, and then puts down blocks to free the arm and to clear the table. Then I pickup and stack blocks according to the goal state, and the landmarks.

I've carefully verified that the preconditions of all stack actions are met. I've also verified that the goal state of the blocksworld domain is met with the generated plan.
