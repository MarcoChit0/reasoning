**Alright, let's break down this Blocks World problem from my perspective.** I've been given a domain, an initial state, and a set of "landmark" actions. My job is to craft a complete PDDL plan that gets the blocks from their initial configuration to a desired goal state. The landmark actions are essentially guideposts – crucial actions that *must* appear in the plan, and crucially, in the *specified order*.

The core of the challenge, as I see it, is handling the preconditions of the actions, particularly the stacking and unstacking moves. For a `stack` action, I need to make sure the arm is empty, and the target block is clear.  For an `unstack` action, the block being moved *must* be clear and the arm must be empty. The initial setup requires a significant unstacking phase to clear away the stacks.

Here's the approach:

1.  **Unstacking Phase:** I start with the given initial state and the first landmark, `(unstack b25 b3)`.  Because unstacking requires a clear block on top, and those are given to me in the description, I execute the sequence of `unstack` actions. The effects are, `holding block` and `clear target`. Because I only have one arm, I then must insert `putdown` actions to put blocks temporarily on the table to meet the `clear` preconditions of subsequent actions.

2.  **Stacking Phase:** Once all the original stacks are broken down, I begin building up the new configuration, again, following the landmarks.  Now, the `stack` actions dictate the shape. Now, I have to ensure the stacking actions have their preconditions fulfilled – specifically the clear-block requirement, this is simple because I know that after `putdown`, all blocks are clear. Then, pick up the stacked block and `stack` it.

Throughout this process, I mentally maintain the current state (mainly the `on`, `clear`, `arm-empty` predicates), ensure that preconditions are satisfied before any action, and I only insert other `pickup`, and `putdown` actions to bridge gaps to fulfill the landmark's needs.

The main complexity arises from the number of blocks and the simple unstack-putdown-pickup-stack process needed for any valid plan.
The plan then, must contain the actions in this described and explained process.
