; This shows issues with the rigid following of first-appearance.
; A more robust way to use landmarks is to ensure they are present.
; Since the problem explicitly states "The action landmarks are provided in a feasible order; this means that there is at least one valid plan that could be built following the action landmarks order. Note that this ordering is not necessarily unique; this means that there could exist other valid plans that could be built following the action landmarks from another ordering. Note that the order only needs to be respected for the first appearance of each landmark in the plan."
; The plan generated in thought process is complex. I'll provide a simpler one that just ensures landmarks are present and goals are met, in a logical flow.

; Re-evaluating based on general logistics flow.
; 1. Trucks move to packages within their city, collect packages.
; 2. Trucks move collected packages to city's airport.
; 3. Airplane moves to collect all packages, flies to destination airports.
; 4. At destination airports, packages are unloaded from airplane and loaded onto local trucks.
; 5. Trucks deliver packages to final destinations within their city.

; Resetting and building from scratch, following this logic, ensuring landmarks are hit at logical points.
; It will be a longer list of intermediate actions but hopefully more coherent.

**Refined Logistics Planning Approach**

My core objective is to create a PDDL plan for a complex logistics problem. I'm focusing on a rigid interpretation of "feasible order." That is, I'm taking the landmarks (key actions) as an absolute sequence that must be executed in order, with all required preconditions fulfilled, even if it creates an inefficient plan.

The problem centers on delivering 27 packages to various destinations using trucks and an airplane. I need to take into account these "landmarks" -  actions that provide a structured plan sequence to be followed. I'll maintain detailed state tracking. Each unique landmark has to be the first of its kind, and the sequence must be maintained as far as the first use of each unique landmark. Intermediate actions will be inserted to satisfy preconditions and to get the required objects to the necessary locations, always checking if these intermediate actions introduce any new landmark actions and processing them in order.

I'm developing a step-by-step plan:

1.  **Strict Landmark Processing:**
    *   Iterate through the landmarks in the provided order.
    *   For each landmark, check if it's already been "used" in the plan (first appearance fulfilled). If so, skip it.
    *   If not, generate the necessary sequence of actions to fulfill all preconditions. This includes intermediate driving, flying, loading, and unloading.
    *   Add this generated sequence (including the landmark itself) to the main plan.
    *   Mark the landmark as "used."
    *   I'll maintain object locations, truck contents, and airplane contents to build the sequence. I'll update the state after each action in the plan.
2.  **State Tracking:** I will rigorously manage the objects' `at` locations, what objects the trucks and the airplane are carrying (`in_obj_carrier`) and where the carriers (trucks, airplane) are located (`carrier_loc`).
3.  **Detailed action generation**:
    *   For each unfulfilled landmark `(load-truck obj truck loc)` or `(load-airplane obj plane loc)`, I will derive:
        *   Where is `obj`? If not at `loc`, add actions to get it there.
        *   Where is `truck` or `plane`? If not at `loc`, add driving or flying actions to get it there.
        *   Then, execute the landmark.
4.  **Landmark accounting**:
    *   I'll keep a set of `consumed_landmarks`. Once a landmark `LM` is used, I'll update the `consumed_landmarks` and will not use `LM` for new actions until its first appearance in order is met.

This method will be long and produce an inefficient plan due to this strict landmark ordering. I'm prepared for this and will carefully implement it for the given problem instance.
