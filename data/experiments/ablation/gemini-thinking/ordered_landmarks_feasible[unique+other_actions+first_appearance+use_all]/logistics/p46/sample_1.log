**Logistics Plan Generation for the Logistics Domain**

Okay, so I've got this logistics problem in PDDL format, with the domain file, the instance file, and some action landmarks in a specific order that needs to be respected. My goal is to come up with a valid plan that moves all the packages to their destination, taking these landmarks into account. I'm imagining a plan where I have to move packages with trucks and an airplane from different cities.

I've broken this down: The goal is to get every package, `pX`, to the location specified in `(at pX lY-Z)`. There are different objects: airplanes, trucks, cities and packages. I'm dealing with packages being moved from their starting points to the places where they must ultimately be.

Here's the basic idea:
1.  **Identify Package Movements:** Figure out where each package is initially and where it needs to go.
2.  **Determine the Transport:**
    *   **Different cities:** Airplane! This needs these parts:
        *   Truck to the origin airport.
        *   Loading onto the airplane.
        *   The airplane flying to the destination airport.
        *   Unloading from the airplane.
        *   Truck from the airport to the final location.
    *   **Same city:** Truck!
        *   Truck to where the package is.
        *   Loading onto the truck.
        *   The truck driving to the destination.
        *   Unloading from the truck.
3.  **Use the Landmarks:** The landmarks are: `LOAD-TRUCK`, `LOAD-AIRPLANE`, `UNLOAD-TRUCK`, and `UNLOAD-AIRPLANE`. Every package will be loaded and unloaded at least once, and I will be using those actions for each package's first appearance in the landmark set. This means I'll need `DRIVE-TRUCK` and `FLY-AIRPLANE`.

I'm analyzing the packages and how they move.
*   **Same city transfer:** `p6`, `p10`, `p13`, `p16` - Truck
*   **Different cities:**  Requires the airplane.

I am analyzing one package called p2, which has its landmarks
1.  `(at p2 l0-1)`
2.  `t0` needs to go to `l0-1`. `(at t0 l0-0)` initially.
   `DRIVE-TRUCK t0 l0-0 l0-1 c0`
3.  `(load-truck p2 t0 l0-1)`
4.  `t0` needs to go to `l0-0` (airport).
   `DRIVE-TRUCK t0 l0-1 l0-0 c0`
5.  At `l0-0`, `p2` needs to be moved from `t0` to `a0`. The landmark `(unload-truck p2 t0 l0-0)` is there.
   `UNLOAD-TRUCK p2 t0 l0-0` -> `(at p2 l0-0)`
6.  `a0` is at `l0-0` initially.
   `LOAD-AIRPLANE p2 a0 l0-0` -> `(in p2 a0)`
7.  `a0` needs to fly from `l0-0` (c0 airport) to `l1-0` (c1 airport).
   `FLY-AIRPLANE a0 l0-0 l1-0`
8.  At `l1-0`, `p2` needs to be moved from `a0` to `t1`. The landmark `(unload-airplane p2 a0 l1-0)` is there.
   `UNLOAD-AIRPLANE p2 a0 l1-0` -> `(at p2 l1-0)`
9.  `t1` needs to go to `l1-0`. `(at t1 l1-1)` initially.
   `DRIVE-TRUCK t1 l1-1 l1-0 c1`
10. At `l1-0`, `p2` needs to be loaded onto `t1`. The landmark `(load-truck p2 t1 l1-0)` is there.
    `LOAD-TRUCK p2 t1 l1-0` -> `(in p2 t1)`
11. `t1` needs to go from `l1-0` to `l1-2` (goal).
    `DRIVE-TRUCK t1 l1-0 l1-2 c1`
