**Pondering a PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Right, here's the situation: I've got a blocksworld problem, and I need a plan that takes the initial configuration to the goal state.  Crucially, I need to obey some 'landmark' actions â€“ these are like important stepping stones in the solution.

First, I've got to understand the building blocks of this world. There are blocks (naturally), the table, and a robot arm. Blocks can be clear (nothing on top), on the table, held by the arm, or on top of another block.  The actions are standard: pick up from the table, put down on the table, stack one block onto another, and unstack. I've got to generate a plan that does just this.

The initial state is a jumbled set of blocks on blocks and the table.  The goal is a tidy arrangement of stacks.  There's a bunch of blocks and blocks that I need to re-arrange to reach my goal stack configuration.

Alright, the initial step is always to get everything 'out of the way'. To do this, I scan the blocks in the initial state to identify stacks. I see a couple of stacks and some independent blocks that are on table, but not goal positions. And, I analyze the goal state. I see several stacks that need to be constructed.

Based on the blocks in the initial state, I begin by breaking down any stacks so that blocks are `on-table` and `clear`. To accomplish this, I must follow the action landmarks and ensure that preconditions are satisfied at all times. This will involve the use of the `unstack` action to remove any blocks that block other blocks that are part of the target goal stacks.

The action landmarks are in a pre-defined sequence of `unstack` and `stack` actions that need to be followed. This means I'll need to generate a plan that respects the landmark action sequence.

I need a way to build the plan, so I will track each action landmark by constructing a series of `unstack`, and `stack`, actions. Before each `unstack` operation, I will have to ensure that all the precondition predicates are satisfied; therefore, I will generate a corresponding series of `putdown` actions to ensure each block has an associated `arm-empty` state. 

After all the blocks are on the table and clear, I'll then use the remaining landmarks (`stack`) to put the stacks together based on the goal conditions. For the `stack` actions, if the block isn't held (from a previous unstack), a corresponding `pickup` action is needed. 

I'll check the validity of these operations and the overall logic.

So, the plan generation phase will include a series of `unstack` followed by `putdown` actions to remove blocks and their dependent stacks and a series of `pickup` and `stack` actions to construct each of the desired goal stacks, based on the landmarks. If a non-landmark action is necessary, it will be added to the sequence. The order of both actions must be respected. I must remember that landmark order is relative, and not absolute.

The plan should generate a series of `unstack` operations to make the blocks on table, followed by a series of `pickup` and `stack` operations (with `pickup` and `putdown` as needed) to arrange the blocks to the goal configuration.
