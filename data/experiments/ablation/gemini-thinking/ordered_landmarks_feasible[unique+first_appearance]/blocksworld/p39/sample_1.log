**Automated Plan Generation for a Blocksworld Instance**

My primary goal is to create a PDDL plan that transforms a given blocksworld initial state into a specific goal state, using a defined domain and a sequence of crucial "landmark" actions. These landmarks provide a roadmap for the plan, and my process is built around incorporating them in the given order. However, I also need to account for intermediate steps. Specifically, I must insert `pickup` and `putdown` actions as needed to make the landmarks feasible or to create clear blocks to support those landings.

The initial and goal states are parsed to understand where blocks begin and where they need to end up. The landmarks are then examined. A typical "unstack" landmark, for example, signals a need to move a block from on top of another. To handle this, I make the arm empty, then `unstack` the top block. Next, I `putdown` blocks on the table.

This initial phase is about freeing up blocks. Once most blocks are on the table, the stack landmarks instruct the plan to build the goal state. A pickup action is performed only after ensuring the arm is empty, and stack actions are only possible if the base block is clear. The order of the stack landmarks is key to building the stack plan.

I have generated a plan with 112 actions, which are comprised of unstack actions, putdown actions, pickup actions, and stack actions.
