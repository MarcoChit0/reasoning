**My Planning Strategy for the Blocksworld Domain**

Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a PDDL plan for this `blocksworld` domain, sticking precisely to the prescribed action landmarks and, crucially, the specified order. I'm taking a systematic approach here, as this type of planning problem lends itself well to it.

First, I need to thoroughly understand the initial state and the desired goal state. Essentially, I need to know where all the blocks *start* and where they need to *end up*. This involves reading the initial facts and the goal conditions. I'm focusing on the `on` and `clear` predicates, along with `arm-empty`. These will be the building blocks of my plan.

The core of my approach is to process the landmarks in the strict order presented. For each landmark, I'll need to assess the current state. If the landmark action's preconditions are already met, then I can directly include the action. If not, I'll need to "bridge the gap" by inserting any necessary intermediate actions to fulfill those preconditions. This will primarily be `pickup` and `putdown` actions to manipulate blocks and ensure the arm is clear when needed.

Let's illustrate with an example: the first landmark is `(unstack b13 b1)`. I examine the initial state. I verify if `(on b13 b1)`, `(clear b13)`, and `(arm-empty)` are all true. If so, I can execute `(unstack b13 b1)`. Then, I must consider the state *after* the action. Now, the arm holds b13. The *next* step must be a `putdown` action to make the arm free for the *next* landmark.

I'll methodically work through each landmark, inserting necessary `pickup` and `putdown` actions as needed. After handling the unstacking phase dictated by the landmarks, I'll move on to the stacking instructions. This is crucial because it will define the final arrangement of the blocks, matching them to the goal state.

When all the required stacking landmarks are complete, I'll perform a final check.  I need to confirm that all of the goal conditions are *actually* satisfied in the final state *after* the actions are completed.  If I've planned correctly, I will have a complete and valid plan for the task.
