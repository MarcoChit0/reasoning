**Alright, here's my plan.** I'm going to take this blocksworld instance and figure out a PDDL plan to get it from the initial state to the goal state. I've got the domain, the instance details, and crucially, the action landmarks.  The landmarks are like a roadmap, a good starting point, and I'll use them to build the plan. Since the landmarks are provided in a feasible order, I should try to use them as a skeleton for my plan, only inserting the extra pick-up, put-down and reordering actions that are needed to actually make things work.

First, I looked at the initial state and the goal state to get a handle on what needs to be done. Lots of blocks are in the wrong place!

I know I have to take the following steps in order, because these must be done for a valid plan. Now, I have to find a strategy to satisfy all goal conditions and also follow these steps:

Landmark Actions:

(unstack b25 b28)
(unstack b28 b16)
(unstack b16 b2)
(unstack b2 b1)
(unstack b1 b15)
(unstack b15 b20)
(unstack b20 b4)
(unstack b7 b12)
(unstack b12 b8)
(unstack b3 b24)
(unstack b24 b10)
(unstack b14 b6)
(unstack b6 b9)
(unstack b9 b11)
(unstack b22 b23)
(unstack b23 b27)
(unstack b27 b13)
(unstack b13 b21)
(unstack b21 b17)
(unstack b17 b18)
(unstack b19 b26)
(stack b24 b8)
(stack b19 b24)
(stack b28 b19)
(stack b9 b28)
(stack b7 b18)
(stack b6 b16)
(stack b12 b6)
(stack b13 b12)
(stack b25 b13)
(stack b23 b25)
(stack b21 b23)
(stack b27 b21)
(stack b14 b27)
(pickup b10)
(stack b10 b14)
(pickup b4)
(stack b4 b10)
(pickup b5)
(stack b5 b17)
(pickup b11)
(stack b11 b2)
(stack b3 b11)
(stack b22 b26)
(stack b1 b22)
(stack b15 b1)

Then, I'm simulating what happens at each step, making the whole stack of block transformations for reaching our goal. I'm adding `putdown` actions to clear the arm whenever I have to pick up another block.

I found one tricky thing that's related to (on b20 b4) goal. After some unstacking, `b4` is stacked on `b10`. I thought, how can I place b20 on b4 if b4 is covered? My simulation showed that the goal would conflict with these conditions. But then I figured out that, (stack B A) is not clear in B. But after it, B is clear. B can be stacked on something else, and it will be clear.

The only valid way to build the stack b20-b4-b10-b14 is:
- (unstack b20 b4)
- (putdown b20)
- ... (some actions that would rearrange things)
- (pickup b10)
- (stack b10 b14)
- (pickup b4)
- (stack b4 b10)
- (pickup b20)
- (stack b20 b4)

The "feasible order" of landmarks implies that the plan should place them in the correct sequence. The sequence is built for a tower, top-down and the structure must be maintained. I would add non-landmark actions and achieve a complete plan.
So after stacking B on A, B becomes clear. Then another block can be stacked on B. I just had to be careful to get the order right.

Now I am confident that the landmark order has been followed. The goal is reached.
