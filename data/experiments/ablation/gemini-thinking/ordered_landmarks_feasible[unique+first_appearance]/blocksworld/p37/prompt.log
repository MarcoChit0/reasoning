<problem-description-with-landmarks>
You are a highly skilled professor in AI planning. Your task is to generate a plan for a PDDL instance from the domain <domain>blocksworld</domain>.
You will be given the PDDL domain file, the PDDL instance file, and the set of action landmarks extracted from the delete relaxation of the instance.
Action landmarks are actions that must be part of any valid plan for the instance.
Since the action landmarks are extracted from the delete relaxation of the instance, they represent a subset of the action landmarks of the instance.
The action landmarks are provided in a feasible order; this means that there is at least one valid plan that could be built following the action landmarks order.
Note that this ordering is not necessarily unique; this means that there could exist other valid plans that could be built following the action landmarks from another ordering.
Note that the order only needs to be respected for the first appearance of each landmark in the plan.
You need to return the plan between the tags <plan> and </plan>.
You will receive two examples to help you in generating the plan.

Provide only the plan for the given instance. Here is a checklist to help you with your problem:
<checklist>
1) The plan must be in the same format as the examples above.
2) The plan should be preceded by the <plan> tag and should be followed by the </plan> tag.
3) The actions in the plan must be from the set of actions in the domain described above, that is, they must use the same name and the same number of parameters as one of the action schemas.
4) The plan must be valid, that is, each action must be applicable in the state it is applied, and the plan must end in a goal state.
