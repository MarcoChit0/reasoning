**Here's how I'm approaching this blocksworld problem:**

My goal is to create a PDDL plan to rearrange the blocks according to the specified goal state. The problem gives me two crucial pieces of information: the initial configuration of the blocks and the desired final arrangement. It also provides a set of *landmarks*, which are intermediate actions that I must include in my plan in the order given. The key to solving this is to find the minimum set of intermediate steps that achieve each of these landmarks in order.

First, I need to understand the start and end states. I meticulously analyze the initial state, noting the position of each block (e.g., `on b1 b17`) and which blocks are clear (meaning nothing is stacked on top). I then do the same for the goal state, identifying the desired final positions.

With the states in mind, I can start with the landmarks. In general, to *unstack* a block, it needs to be clear, and the arm must be empty. To *stack* a block, I need to have the block in my hand, and the target block must be clear. To *pickup* a block, it must be on the table and clear, and the arm must be empty. To *putdown* a block, I need to have it.

The landmarks are given in a "feasible order," meaning they should work if performed in order. I'll take each landmark one by one and determine what steps are needed to make it happen, making sure that my arm is empty before I attempt to pick up blocks and stacked blocks are cleared.

This process involves a lot of state simulation. I'll maintain a simulated state to keep track of the block configuration as I apply actions. For each landmark, I'll identify the *preconditions* (the conditions that must be true) and the *effects* (the changes that will be made). I start by checking if preconditions are met. If not, I'll insert actions before the landmark to resolve the preconditions, for example by putting a block down, unstacking clear blocks, and so forth. I repeat this process for each of the landmarks, making sure I add actions to get things in the correct state, and finally verify that all conditions in the goal state are met.

Once I've completed this detailed process for all the blocks in the required order, I will have a complete plan. This plan consists of individual actions like `unstack`, `stack`, `pickup`, and `putdown`, with pre-conditions met in order. I'm very confident I can create a complete and valid plan.
