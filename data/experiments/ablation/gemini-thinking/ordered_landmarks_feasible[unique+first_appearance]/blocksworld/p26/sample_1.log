**Comprehensive PDDL Plan Generation**

Alright, let's break this down. My objective is to generate a PDDL plan for this `blocksworld` scenario, ensuring I adhere to the given action landmarks â€“ these are key and must be incorporated in the correct order. The plan must achieve every single goal condition.

First, I need to thoroughly understand the initial state of the world: which blocks are on the table, which are stacked, and which are clear. Then, I have to grasp the desired final state, or the goal conditions, where specific blocks must be stacked in precise arrangements.

The heart of the challenge is the landmarks. I need to make sure I execute these specific actions in their designated order. It's like a carefully laid-out path I need to follow. The process might involve intermediate steps, like picking up or putting down blocks, to satisfy the preconditions of each landmark action.

To create this PDDL plan, I'll need to use the available predicates (like `on`, `clear`, `arm-empty`) and actions (like `pickup`, `putdown`, `unstack`, `stack`). The plan creation involves a deep dive into the starting and ending arrangement of the blocks. I'll need to analyze the initial and goal states thoroughly, paying close attention to the `clear` and `on-table` predicates.

The provided landmark sequence is: `(unstack b16 b20)`, `(unstack b20 b9)`, `(unstack b9 b11)`, `(unstack b11 b22)`, `(unstack b22 b19)`, `(unstack b19 b14)`, `(unstack b14 b15)`, `(unstack b15 b18)`, `(unstack b18 b7)`, `(unstack b7 b8)`, `(unstack b8 b2)`, `(unstack b2 b1)`, `(unstack b4 b5)`, `(unstack b5 b10)`, `(unstack b10 b3)`, `(unstack b6 b13)`, `(unstack b13 b12)`, `(unstack b12 b17)`, `(unstack b17 b21)`, `(putdown b17)` then the landmarks are as follows: `(stack b8 b17)`, `(stack b6 b8)`, `(stack b16 b6)`, `(stack b18 b16)`, `(stack b9 b15)`, `(stack b11 b9)`, `(stack b2 b11)`, `(stack b19 b12)`, `(stack b7 b19)`, `(stack b22 b7)`, `(stack b4 b13)`, `(stack b14 b4)`, `(pickup b21)`, `(stack b21 b14)`, `(pickup b20)`, `(stack b20 b3)`, `(pickup b1)`, `(stack b1 b10)`.

A key aspect is that the landmarks themselves do not fully detail the plan, and therefore I needed to derive a complete one.

I need to make sure I add *additional* `pickup` and `putdown` actions as needed. This will be the result of careful reasoning about the current and goal states, as it will be necessary in order to achieve the specified goal conditions. I will pay careful attention to the preconditions of each action and what effects that action has on the state of the world.

So, here's my plan to construct the PDDL plan:
1.  **Analyze the initial and goal states:** Start by carefully understanding the starting and goal conditions of all blocks.
2.  **Order of Landmarks:** Execute each landmark action in the given order.
3.  **Intermediate actions:** The required pre-conditions of each action will determine when to add `pickup` and `putdown` actions to the plan.
4.  **Careful state tracking:** It is crucial to check `arm-empty`, `clear`, and `on-table` predicates after each action.

This methodical approach should yield a valid PDDL plan that will correctly satisfy all the goal conditions!
