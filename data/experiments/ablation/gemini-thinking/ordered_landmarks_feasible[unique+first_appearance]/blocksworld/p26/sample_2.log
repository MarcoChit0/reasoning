**Generating a PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, let's get down to business. I'm tasked with crafting a plan for a classic blocksworld problem, aiming to transition from a given initial state to a desired goal state. The challenge? Respect the prescribed order of action landmarks. These landmarks essentially act as waypoints that guide the plan's construction.

My initial approach involves meticulously analyzing both the start and the goal configurations. The initial state gives me the current arrangement of blocks, with their positions (on-table, on top of other blocks) and the arm's state (empty). The goal state outlines the final block arrangements we need to achieve.

The strategy that emerges is to systematically disassemble the initial configuration, ensuring that all blocks are initially on the table and clear. Then, I can proceed with the goal's stacking instructions. The landmarks provide a valid order for this, so I will follow that order.

Now, for the actual plan generation, I'll go step by step, simulating each action and verifying that all preconditions are met before executing them. For actions like `unstack` (taking a block from another) and `stack` (putting it on another), I need to check the preconditions carefully. For the unstack, I need to know the block is clear and that I have an empty arm. For stack, I need to check the block in hand and ensure the destination block is clear.

The key is to manage the state after each step. Actions' effects, like the `clear` predicate changing, should be tracked closely. I might need additional actions, like `putdown`, to manage my arm's state. I must ensure the preconditions are met before taking action.

It's clear that the given landmark set ensures the plan's feasibility. The problem states that the landmarks appear in a feasible order. So, I will proceed by following the landmark order and insert additional, non-landmark actions where necessary to meet the precondition for an upcoming landmark. It's a mix of a search process and constraint checking.

For non-landmark stacks, such as one required by an on goal state, I will have to insert that `pickup` and `stack` action as well. The provided landmark action order must be satisfied only for the first appearance of the landmark action. Therefore, I must use all landmark actions, but they may not be the first thing I do.

Ultimately, I'll arrive at a complete PDDL plan, which starts with systematically unstacking all blocks, putting them down, then executing the landmark `stack` actions and intermediate actions to build the goal state.
