**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**

Alright, let's break this down. The task is to create a PDDL plan for a blocksworld scenario, given the domain, instance, and a list of action "landmarks" that must be included in the plan. The landmarks represent key actions that have to occur, in the order they're presented.

My first step is to fully grasp the goal state (what the blocks need to look like at the end) and the initial state (how the blocks are positioned initially).  I'll need to carefully analyze these states to understand what actions are required. The key is to incorporate the landmark actions while building a valid plan, ensuring the landmark's order is respected from first to last appearance.

**Detailed Analysis and Plan Development**

I will treat the blocks as a current state model and go over the plan using the landmarks as reference points. Each landmark is an `action`, so for each landmark I will carefully look at the preconditions (what needs to be true for the action to be possible) and effects (what changes when the action is applied). If any preconditions aren't met, I'll insert 'preparatory' actions (like `pickup` or `putdown`) before applying the landmark action itself.

Crucially, I need to manage block states meticulously. If an action's effects make a block unavailable for a future landmark (for instance, stacking a block when it's needed elsewhere), I'll need to add actions to manage that, potentially moving the block back to the table, or restacking it.

**Specific Challenges and Approach**

The most critical issue is that the given landmarks may not be sufficient to achieve the entire goal. I suspect I'll need to add actions. The problem of `on b18 b17` demonstrates this very point, since landmarks cause `b18` and `b17` to separate initially.

To address this:
1.  **Iterative State Tracking**: I'll meticulously track the state of each block (position, clearness) after each action, adding actions as needed.
2.  **Landmark Order**: Landmark application will be based on the principle of *first appearance* of any landmark actions to ensure the order is correct.
3.  **Local Goal Fulfilment**: Since `(on b18 b17)` is a goal, I'll re-establish it after it's been removed if needed, so the plan considers the necessary pre- and post- conditions.
4.  **Action Insertion**: I will insert actions whenever it becomes clear that preconditions of landmark actions are not met. I will add auxiliary actions to facilitate the landmark actions.
5.  **State Verification**: I will constantly verify if the goal state is achieved by carefully tracking the positions of each block at any given time.

**Plan Construction**

I will list the actions required to solve the blocksworld instance with the following steps:
1.  Unstack the blocks and put them on the table using the `unstack` landmarks and putdown actions to get all blocks `clear` and `arm-empty`.
2.  I will then analyze the goals that are not explicitly provided by the landmarks and add actions to make those goals true.
3.  Then I will go over the landmark `stack` actions and create a plan, adding `pickup` and stack actions as needed.

After each iteration, I will check whether the goal state is completely achieved, and whether the landmark actions are included and properly ordered.
