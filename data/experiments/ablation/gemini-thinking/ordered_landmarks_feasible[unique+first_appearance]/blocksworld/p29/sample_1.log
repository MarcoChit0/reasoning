**Comprehensive Blocksworld Plan Generation**

As a seasoned planning expert, I've approached this PDDL blocksworld problem methodically. The objective is to craft a valid plan that efficiently transforms the initial state into a specific goal state, while adhering to a pre-defined sequence of landmark actions.

Here's my thought process:

1.  **Problem Decomposition:** I've dissected the problem into understanding the goal state (block stacking configurations) and meticulously analyzing the initial state, identifying clear blocks and on-table blocks.

2.  **Strategic Planning:** My core strategy involves traversing the landmarks in order. For each landmark action (e.g., `(unstack b1 b3)`), I check if its preconditions are met in the current state. If not, I devise a sequence of "helper" actions to fulfill those preconditions. This frequently involves actions to clear the area, or if `b2` is supporting `b21` and that creates a problem for `on b18 b17`, a sub-sequence is generated to unstack, move around, and stack again as needed.

3.  **State Tracking and Action Sequencing:** I'm meticulously tracking the state of the world as I simulate each action. When a landmark action can't be executed immediately due to conflicts (e.g., the arm is holding a block), I generate actions to resolve the conflict (e.g., put the block down on a safe spot, or the table to make space). The plan grows by chaining actions to meet those conditions, and these are often `unstack bX bY` followed by a `putdown bX` to ensure the blocks are cleared.

4.  **Managing Landmark Constraints:** Landmarks, while critical, don't define a complete plan. I have to design a supporting plan around them. The "first appearance" rule for landmarks is key.

5.  **Addressing the Contradiction:** I identified a tricky situation related to placing block `b18` over `b17` with `(on b18 b17)`. The plan generated actions to dismantle and move blocks to get the specific configuration.

6.  **Full Plan Structure:** The final plan follows a structured format:

    *   Unstacking phase: Blocks are disassembled from their starting positions and moved to the table, using `unstack X Y` and `putdown X` patterns.
    *   Building Phase: The goal stacks are then built, respecting the landmark order, through a sequence of `pickup` and `stack` actions.
    *   Fix: A final correction stage deals with any remaining goals that the sequence alone can't handle. In this case, it was generating an sequence of action to put `b18` over `b17`.

I've carefully considered the pre and post conditions of all the actions and accounted for all block movements. This careful analysis resulted in a comprehensive plan that is both feasible and correct.
