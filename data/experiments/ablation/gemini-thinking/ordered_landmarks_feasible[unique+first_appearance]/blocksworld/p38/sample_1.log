**A Detailed PDDL Plan for the Blocksworld Instance**

Alright, let's break this down. My goal is to craft a PDDL plan for this Blocksworld problem, using the provided domain, instance data, and, crucially, the action landmarks.  The landmarks are given to me in a specific, feasible order, meaning I should try to incorporate them into the plan in the order provided.

I've examined the goal state: it's a complex set of `on` predicates, which means I'll need to carefully stack blocks in specific configurations.  I started by analyzing the initial state, noting the position of each block, the state of the arm (`arm-empty`), and which blocks were clear (i.e., had nothing on top of them).

The landmarks suggested an approach I'm very familiar with:  first, I needed to unstack blocks to clear the way.  Then, I would pick up the "to be stacked" blocks and stack them in the precise configuration outlined by the goal.

My initial approach involved a comprehensive scan of the initial state. I had to understand how to apply and incorporate the landmarks in a feasible, optimal order.

1.  I started with clearing all blocks that had any on them; that is, those that *were not* on the table, to their on-table positions.  To achieve this, I systematically processed the `unstack` predicates.  For each block that had something on top, I planned an `unstack` action to remove the top block, and then a `putdown` to place it on the table.
2.  Next, I needed to create stack patterns for missing goals, since the initial landmarks weren't comprehensive.  I did this by adding two `stack` actions: for `b9`, I planned `pickup` and `stack` actions to ensure `(on b9 b18)`. Similarly, I added a corresponding action for `b11`.
3.  Then, I followed the `stack` landmarks precisely, adding `pickup` actions whenever a block needed to be moved.

I've carefully incorporated those two new `stack` actions into the plan.

This plan builds the stacks bottom-up.  I then carefully checked it against all the goal conditions to ensure that the order of stacking was correct and that I addressed those edge cases.  I've verified that the actions I've added are indeed necessary to satisfy all the goal conditions and are consistent with the "feasible order" of the landmarks.

The generated plan now is a complete solution, taking into account the initial state, goal state, the order of the given action landmarks and ensuring all goal predicates are satisfied.  I'm confident in its correctness, given my experience with these types of problems.
