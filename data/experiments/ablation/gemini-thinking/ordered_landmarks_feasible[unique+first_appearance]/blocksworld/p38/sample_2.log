**Generating a PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, let's craft that PDDL plan.  I'm presented with a blocksworld instance and a list of action landmarks, and my goal is to arrange the blocks so that the goal predicates are satisfied. The key is to leverage the landmark orderingâ€”it's a feasible sequence, so I'll try to weave them into the plan in the given order. However, I know I might need to sprinkle in additional actions like `pickup` and `putdown` to deal with preconditions or move some blocks around to make the landmark actions possible.

My initial approach will be this:

1. **Understand the Setup**:  Get a handle on the initial state of the blocks and the specific goal arrangement. I need a clear mental picture of what I'm starting with and where I need to go.
2. **Handle the Landmarks**: I'll go through the landmarks one by one, ensuring the preconditions are met before each one. If something's out of place, I need to figure out what actions are needed to fix it.
3. **Track Changes**: After each action, I'll update the state. I need to know which blocks are clear, which are being held, which are on the table, etc.
4. **Build the Plan**: I'll build the plan step-by-step, inserting the necessary actions.

**Initial State:**
I've got the initial state, with those `(on ?x ?y)` predicates and (arm-empty). I'll analyze those initial facts, noting the state. I will make sure the table has been cleared and the blocks are reassembled in the desired configuration using `pickup` and `stack` actions. The state updates will be carefully tracked.

**Goal State:**
I'll pay careful attention to the goal state, the `(on ?x ?y)` predicates that describe the target configuration of the blocks.

**The Strategy**

The landmarks are organized with those `unstack` actions first to dismantle the original stacks, and then the re-stacking. The intention is clear: first clear the table and then reassemble the blocks to meet the goal. I should probably focus on making sure to track the changing state accurately with the effect of `clear` `on` `holding` and `arm-empty`.

Alright, let's get down to it. I'll translate the problem and apply my planning expertise to build that PDDL plan.
