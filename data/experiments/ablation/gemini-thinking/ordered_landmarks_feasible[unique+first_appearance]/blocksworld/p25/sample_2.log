**Plan Generation for Blocksworld**

Okay, so I'm tasked with creating a PDDL plan for a `blocksworld-4ops` instance. The challenge is that I'm given a set of action *landmarks*, which are basically key steps, and I need to come up with a valid plan where these landmarks appear in the specified order. The goal is to move blocks around until they're in a particular configuration. I know the domain, so I'm familiar with the `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack` actions. The instance has objects, an initial state, and a goal state.

First, I had to deeply understand the preconditions and effects of these actions. For example, to `pickup` a block, it needs to be clear, on the table, and the arm must be empty.  Then, by "simulating" the state changes, I can make a valid plan. I looked at the goal, which defined all "on" relations, but some "on" relations had to be broken up, meaning I needed to ensure that these relations still hold in the end state. I looked at the initial state to get a grasp of which actions had to be done.

The landmarks gave me a clear idea of how to structure the plan. I went through each landmark action in the order provided. For each landmark, I first made sure its preconditions were met. If not, I added the necessary `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, or `unstack` actions before the landmark. I worked my way through the sequence, making sure all the blocks I needed were on the table, or the arm was empty.

My main strategy here was to use the landmarks as stepping stones. I'm essentially building the plan backward from those key steps, putting in whatever actions are needed to make them possible. Because the landmarks were ordered, I just needed to add intermediate actions. I went through the entire state of operations and checked to see that the goal state's "on" relations were valid. I realized that the landmarks don't cover everything.  For the blocks that need to go on new blocks, I had to ensure the preconditions were met. For this, I added additional `pickup` and `stack` steps to get all the blocks to their correct places.

To make it clear, I tracked the `on` and `clear` predicates, which defined the state of each block, to be sure all goals are met. In the end, to fulfill all the criteria and objectives, the final plan has additional `pickup` and `stack` actions. I had to ensure the constraints. I double-checked the goals after adding the new steps. It's valid now because all the goals have met the desired relations.
