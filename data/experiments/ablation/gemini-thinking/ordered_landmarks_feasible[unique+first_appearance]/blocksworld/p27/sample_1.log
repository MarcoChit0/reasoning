**Comprehensive PDDL Plan for the Blocksworld Instance**

Okay, here's the breakdown of my thinking to generate a PDDL plan for this blocksworld instance.  My main goal is to create a plan that transforms the initial state into the desired goal state, following a specified set of actions (the landmarks).

First, I need to analyze the initial and goal states.  I've got the initial state, which details the current block arrangement (who's on what and which blocks are clear). The goal state outlines the target block configuration I need to achieve.

Next, I understand I have a crucial set of "landmarks," which are actions that must be part of *any* valid plan to solve this instance. The landmarks are essentially clues about necessary steps. Crucially, these landmarks are given in a feasible order â€“ a guiding principle. I'll attempt to process them in this order, making them core elements of my plan.

My primary task is to follow the landmark order and insert additional `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack` actions to ensure all pre-conditions are met and the goal is achieved.

I'm starting by thinking about how to get all the blocks onto the table. I'm going to start with the first landmark, `(unstack b13 b6)`, and assess if the preconditions are met in the initial state. Preconditions check for `arm-empty`, `on`, and `clear` conditions. If a precondition isn't met, I'll insert actions before the landmark to achieve it (primarily `putdown` actions to make the arm empty and moving blocks to make them clear).

I'll proceed through the landmarks, inserting necessary actions.
I'll create the main plan in the following steps.
1. Clear the Arm and Table: Perform `unstack` and subsequent `putdown` operations to make sure everything starts off on a level playing field.
2. Build Stacks Based on Goal. First, pickup from the initial states and make those the lowest block in each stack in the goal. Then stack all blocks to reach the goal. 

After generating the plan, I will ensure that each `stack` action has `clear` as a precondition for the bottom block and that the arm is holding the block that will be stacked. This strategy will allow the `goal` configuration to be achieved.

Finally, I'll need to check the goal state against my plan's final state, making certain that the actions I added successfully reach the target. I'll focus on ensuring that the final block configuration matches the described goal. I see there might be conflicts when comparing what I need to do to the landmark order. I need to make some extra "pickups" and "stacking" actions to finish the plan.
