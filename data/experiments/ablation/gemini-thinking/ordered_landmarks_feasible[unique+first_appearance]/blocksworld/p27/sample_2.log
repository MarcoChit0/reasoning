**Comprehensive Blocksworld Planning Summary**

Okay, here's my thought process to tackle this Blocksworld problem.  My main objective is to create a plan that transforms the initial state into the desired goal state. I've been given a set of *action landmarks*, which are like key milestones, and I *must* incorporate these in the correct order. These landmarks are crucial for a valid solution, but there might be other valid plans. The order is only a guide for the first occurrence of an action landmark.

First, I looked at the *initial state* and *goal state* to understand the necessary transformations. It became clear that I'm dealing with a lot of blocks stacked in the wrong positions, which need to be unstacked.

The action landmarks start with a sequence of `unstack` actions. It's sensible because many blocks are initially in incorrect positions and should be on the table.
My strategy, therefore, is to *unstack* all the blocks that need to be moved to satisfy the goal. I need to get them all on the table, clear and arm-empty to get this ready.  To do this, I work through the `unstack` landmarks one by one.  For each, I apply an `unstack` action to remove a block from another and `putdown` actions to the table to make sure the actions are applicable. And after each `putdown`, I ensure the state satisfies the next landmark. So for each landmark I execute, I apply necessary actions such as putdown and pickup.

Once all the blocks are on the table and clear, I'm ready to begin the stacking phase. I check the goal state and see which blocks need to go where, also taking into account that the *initial goal state* had some of the blocks in the same place and now I have to *rebuild* it. This helps me derive the correct sequence of actions for stacking the blocks.

However, a closer look at the *landmarks*, *goal*, and *initial state* reveals a critical detail. The goal state includes `(on b14 b21)` and `(on b17 b5)`. These were *true* in the beginning, but were lost in the unstacking phase. That means I will need to restack these, to accomplish the required goal. I must also consider the landmark for *Stacking* a block.
I looked at the given actions and then I *realized that the sequence in the landmarks implicitly defined the final stack and had all the landmarks that I required*.

Now that the unstacking is done, the actions can begin. Now I can start the Stacking. But there is a *key detail*, there are other intermediate and supporting steps like the *`pickup`* and *`putdown`* action. To make the correct actions I need to include the action that will *satisfy the clear predicate*. Then I will put the action where needed to satisfy the goal.

With this in mind, and remembering that the plan should start with `unstack` and end with `stack`, my complete plan is generated.

Final plan:

1. (unstack b13 b6)
2. (putdown b13)
3. (unstack b18 b7)
4. (putdown b18)
5. (unstack b7 b14)
6. (putdown b7)
7. (unstack b14 b21)
