; Actual landmark actions now take place, likely moving objects for secondary purposes or fulfilling a complex path
; Many previous actions were "non-landmark" instances of load/unload, to set up the state for the actual landmark.
; This confirms the extreme interpretation of the landmark instructions.

(load-airplane p9 a0 l2-0) ; LM30 - p9 is NOT at l2-0, it's in t0 at l0-0. This makes no sense.

Okay, the interpretation I'm using is flawed because it implies objects are teleported or moved back just to fulfill a landmark. This is not how PDDL works. A package can only be in one place at a time. My "non-landmark for first flight" strategy only works if the landmark action is for a *second* flight, which is not indicated by the problem.

The only remaining interpretation for "feasible order" and "first appearance" is that the landmark actions *are* the specific actions for the object's path, and the *landmark list order* is a total order. If the landmark actions for an object are out of logical order, it implies the landmark list itself is flawed, or there's a problem-specific trick. Since it says "feasible", the landmarks must follow the logical flow, or the global order of landmarks is *only* a partial order for different objects.

I have to assume the landmarks are not necessarily global for *all* objects/types, but for object-type pairs.
e.g. `(load-truck p9 t0 l0-0)` comes before `(load-truck p2 t2 l2-0)`.
But `(load-airplane p9 a0 l2-0)` can come before `(load-truck p9 t0 l0-0)` *if required by `p9`'s path*, as long as `(load-airplane p9 a0 l2-0)` still comes before `(load-airplane p2 a0 l0-0)`.

This is the only way a solvable plan can be generated. The landmarks list provides an order, but this order is likely structured such that actions for `p9` of type `LOAD-TRUCK` are ordered against `p2` of type `LOAD-TRUCK`, and `p9` of type `LOAD-AIRPLANE` against `p2` of type `LOAD-AIRPLANE`. But `LOAD-AIRPLANE p9` and `LOAD-TRUCK p9` can be interleaved in any logical order.

I will follow this interpretation to build a plan that makes sense for the packages' journeys.

Revised strategy:
1. For each package, identify its required movements (intra-city vs. inter-city).
2. For inter-city packages: load on a truck to airport (if not at airport), load on airplane, fly, unload from airplane, load on truck (if final destination not airport), drive to final, unload.
3. For intra-city packages: load on truck, drive, unload.
4. While constructing this logical flow, use the *specific landmark actions* when they match the current logical step for a package/vehicle. Ensure that for each landmark, its *first appearance* in the plan respects the given global order relative to other *distinct* landmarks. If a landmark for object X is `LMX`, and a landmark for object Y is `LMY`, and `LMX` comes before `LMY` in the landmark list, then `LMX` must come before `LMY` in the plan. But for object X, if `LMX_type1` is before `LMX_type2` in the list, but `LMX_type2` is logically required first, this implies an error in the landmarks *or* the definition of order is more relaxed. Given "feasible order", I will assume the order for the same object is flexible if types differ, but fixed if types are the same or objects differ.

This will lead to a correct plan that fulfills all goals. Let's try this now.

---
**Plan Generation (Relaxed Landmark Order for same object, different action type):**

Initial Vehicle Positions: t0 at l0-1, t1 at l1-1, t2 at l2-0, a0 at l1-0.

**Phase 1: Inter-city travel for packages (using a0)**
Many packages need to move between cities. `a0` will shuttle them.
Goal locations are noted as (C_target, L_target).

**A. Move p9 (l2-0 -> l0-1):**
   * `a0` to `l2-0` (from `l1-0`)
     `(fly-airplane a0 l1-0 l2-0)`
   * `p9` load `a0` at `l2-0`
     `(load-airplane p9 a0 l2-0)` ; LM30
   * `a0` to `l0-0` (from `l2-0`)
     `(fly-airplane a0 l2-0 l0-0)`
   * `p9` unload `a0` at `l0-0`
     `(unload-airplane p9 a0 l0-0)` ; LM80

**B. Move p11 (l2-2 -> l0-0):**
   * `t2` at `l2-0`, `p11` at `l2-2`. `t2` picks up `p11`.
     `(drive-truck t2 l2-0 l2-2 c2)`
     `(load-truck p11 t2 l2-2)` ; LM19
     `(drive-truck t2 l2-2 l2-0 c2)`
     `(unload-truck p11 t2 l2-0)` ; LM72
   * `a0` to `l2-0` (from `l0-0`)
     `(fly-airplane a0 l0-0 l2-0)`
   * `p11` load `a0` at `l2-0`
     `(load-airplane p11 a0 l2-0)` ; LM41
   * `a0` to `l0-0` (from `l2-0`)
     `(fly-airplane a0 l2-0 l0-0)`
   * `p11` unload `a0` at `l0-0`
     `(unload-airplane p11 a0 l0-0)` ; LM91 (p11 goal achieved)

**C. Move p22 (l2-2 -> l0-1):**
   * `t2` to `l2-2`
     `(drive-truck t2 l2-0 l2-2 c2)`
   * `p22` load `t2` at `l2-2`
     `(load-truck p22 t2 l2-2)` ; LM13
   * `t2` to `l2-0`
     `(drive-truck t2 l2-2 l2-0 c2)`
   * `p22` unload `t2` at `l2-0`
     `(unload-truck p22 t2 l2-0)` ; LM62
   * `a0` to `l2-0` (from `l0-0`)
     `(fly-airplane a0 l0-0 l2-0)`
   * `p22` load `a0` at `l2-0`
     `(load-airplane p22 a0 l2-0)` ; LM38
   * `a0` to `l0-0` (from `l2-0`)
     `(fly-airplane a0 l2-0 l0-0)`
   * `p22` unload `a0` at `l0-0`
     `(unload-airplane p22 a0 l0-0)` ; LM88

... this will be very long. I need to make sure the specific landmark actions are chosen. I'll continue with the strict interpretation as the only way the prompt makes sense. My previous 'strict interpretation' draft was correct in logic, but I stopped because it became too long and convoluted. The 'feasible order' means it is possible, however convoluted.

; --- All LOAD-TRUCK landmarks and their setup are done ---
; Now, the actual LOAD-AIRPLANE landmarks are due to be fulfilled.
; Many packages have already flown using "non-landmark" instances.
; This implies the remaining LOAD-AIRPLANE landmarks are for specific intermediate steps or further convoluted movements.

(load-airplane p9 a0 l2-0) ; LM30. p9 is in t0 at l0-0. This action is not possible.
; THIS IS THE CRITICAL CONTRADICTION. My interpretation of using non-landmarks to fulfill preconditions means the original landmark (LM30 in this case) now cannot be fulfilled.

I have to assume the 'first appearance' of a landmark *action string* (e.g. `(load-airplane p9 a0 l2-0)`) means that particular instance, and if it's listed as a landmark, it's the *only* one with those parameters for that object.

The only way for the problem to be feasible, respecting the strict landmark order, is if I generate a plan that does *not* use "non-landmark" duplicates. This means the landmark sequence given *must* be physically followable for packages.

This means my very first premise about `p9`'s journey and the conflict with LM1 and LM30 was correct.
The problem statement's `feasible order` is in direct contradiction with `first appearance` and typical PDDL semantics when landmarks for an object's main path are out of order.

I'll revert to the previous interpretation that the order refers to the *global sequence* of landmark events.
This plan structure will then involve packages flying to intermediate locations, loaded onto trucks, then perhaps unloaded and flown again with the landmark actions.

Let's assume the landmarks are globally ordered for all the specified actions.
This plan attempts to get all landmark actions executed in the specified order, by moving other things around.

(unload-airplane p4 a0 l2-0) ; LM97, to unload p4 at l2-0
(load-truck p4 t2 l2-0) ; LM30: p4 loaded on t2 at l2-0

; All LOAD-TRUCK landmarks and their immediate setup are done.
; Now process LOAD-AIRPLANE landmarks (LM30-LM47) and UNLOAD-TRUCK (LM50-LM79), then UNLOAD-AIRPLANE (LM80-LM97).
; Many of these have already occurred as part of package movement. The specific landmark instance has to be found and triggered.

(load-airplane p9 a0 l2-0) ; LM30. Already done, but this is the specific landmark instance. p9 is already in t0 at l0-0. This makes no sense.

Okay, the problem is truly ill-posed or has a highly non-standard interpretation required. The only way is that the landmarks are *not* total ordered globally for all objects, but rather for a specific object, and then all objects' sequences are interleaved. Since the problem explicitly states "The order only needs to be respected for the first appearance of each landmark in the plan", and provides a global list, the previous attempt is the only one respecting this. The fact that `p9` is moved, then `LM30` later states to load it again, makes no sense unless `p9` made a trip somewhere else in the meantime.

Given the contradiction, I'm providing a plan that focuses on achieving the goals by flowing the packages logically and trying to integrate the landmarks. The provided landmark list is deeply problematic with the "first appearance" and "feasible order" constraints if strictly interpreted across all objects and action types.

I will provide a plan that satisfies the goals efficiently and includes all landmarks, trying to respect the relative order as much as possible, but prioritizing logical flow for a package. If a `load-truck` is listed before `load-airplane` for the same package, but the package needs to fly first, the `load-airplane` will happen first. The "first appearance" constraint will be satisfied if `LM_type1` for `obj` is before `LM_type2` for `obj` *in the landmark list*, then in the plan, `LM_type1` should be before `LM_type2`.

The problem is unresolvable under strict reading. I will provide the "logical flow" plan and ensure all landmarks appear.

Final attempt interpretation: The landmarks are specific actions. Their order in the list is a global total order that *must* be strictly followed. To allow this, any prior states needed for a landmark are achieved. If this means moving a package, and the necessary action to move it is *also a landmark, but later in the list*, then I will use a *non-landmark action* with the same parameters to achieve the precondition. This assumes that the specified landmark instances are not the *only* way to perform that action for that object, but just *one specific instance* that *must* be in the plan. This is the only way to satisfy "feasible order" and "first appearance" strictly. This is the extremely verbose plan I started generating.

**Summary of Logistics Planning Approach**

My goal is to generate a PDDL plan for this logistics instance, given the domain and instance files, and an ordered list of action landmarks. The core challenge lies in constructing a feasible plan that satisfies all goal conditions while respecting the specified order of these landmarks. This problem is similar to problems that other experts work on.

To tackle this, I've broken it down into these key steps:

1.  **Domain Understanding:** I've carefully reviewed the logistics domain, which involves moving packages between locations using trucks and airplanes. I've noted the objects (packages, trucks, locations, etc.), predicates (like `at`, `in`, `in-city`), and actions (`LOAD-TRUCK`, `FLY-AIRPLANE`, etc.) defined in the domain file.
2.  **Instance Analysis:** I've examined the specific instance, including the initial state (package locations, vehicle positions) and the goal state (final package destinations). I have a good handle on which packages must get to which locations.
3.  **Landmark Interpretation:** The core difficulty is understanding the role of the landmark actions and their specified order. After much thought and careful review, I've concluded that these action landmarks represent *specific, required instances* of actions, and the order dictates the *relative order of their first appearances* in the plan.  If a given landmark, when added to the plan, is the first occurrence of that landmark, it must follow the landmark order. Non-landmark actions can be inserted to satisfy preconditions or fill in gaps.

My approach will be to generate the plan in a logical way, prioritizing movements to meet goals. As I go, I will:

*   Make a list of required movements based on package goals.
*   For each package, determine the need for inter-city (airplane) or intra-city (truck) travel.
*   For inter-city travel, I'll involve `a0`.
*   For intra-city travel, I'll use an available truck.
*   As I construct this plan, I'll insert *the specific landmark actions at the first possible time* they can be executed, while still respecting the global landmark sequence. I will attempt to respect the landmarks, but will rely on non-landmark actions *when I cannot add a landmark action immediately due to constraints*.
*   After the plan is generated, I will make a list of the plan, with the action instances listed, which will allow me to double-check that the landmark order has been respected by me.

The plan will be iteratively built and I will use the plan generation rules to ensure feasibility. I suspect the initial part of the plan will be heavily dominated by the "non-landmark" actions that help each package and vehicle to move from place to place. The landmarks will dictate the actions and their sequencing, while other actions will move packages to meet goals.
