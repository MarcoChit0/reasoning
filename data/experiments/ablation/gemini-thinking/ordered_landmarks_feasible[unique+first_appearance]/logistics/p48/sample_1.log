The problem statement provides a set of action landmarks in a "feasible order," implying that a valid plan can be constructed while respecting this order for the *first appearance* of each specific landmark in the plan. This is a crucial point of interpretation: if an action `A` is a landmark and appears before landmark `B` in the provided list, then `A` must appear before `B` in the generated plan. However, to make `B` executable, intermediate actions might be necessary. If one of these intermediate actions happens to be a landmark that appears *later* in the provided list, this intermediate action *still satisfies that later landmark*. The "first appearance" rule ensures that such a landmark is only explicitly added once to the plan and marked as completed, effectively "pulling it forward" in the sequence.

My strategy to address this is as follows:
1.  Initialize the current state and an empty plan list.
2.  Maintain a `completed_landmarks` set to track specific landmark actions that have already been added to the plan.
3.  Iterate through the provided list of action landmarks in their given order.
4.  For each landmark (`current_lm`):
    a.  If `current_lm` is already in `completed_landmarks`, skip it (it was "pulled forward" by an earlier action).
    b.  Otherwise, attempt to satisfy its preconditions:
        i.  For each unmet precondition, determine the necessary intermediate action (e.g., `drive-truck`, `fly-airplane`, `unload-truck`, `unload-airplane`).
        ii. Add these intermediate actions to the plan. If an intermediate action *exactly matches* a landmark (regardless of its position in the original list), add it to the plan and add it to the `completed_landmarks` set. This correctly applies the "first appearance" rule by using the earliest possible valid execution of that landmark.
    c.  After satisfying all prerequisites, `current_lm` should be executable. Add `current_lm` to the plan, apply its effects to the current state, and add it to `completed_landmarks`.
5.  After processing all landmarks, verify that all packages are at their goal locations. If any package is not at its goal, add additional actions to transport it to its final destination. This final step handles any packages whose journey wasn't fully covered by the landmarks.

This approach ensures that all landmarks are included in the plan, and their relative order is respected, with intermediate actions inserted as needed, and "pulling forward" landmarks when they are necessary prerequisites.
