**Navigating a Complex Logistics Problem**

Okay, here's how I'm thinking about this. I've got a PDDL logistics problem and a list of "landmarks" – essentially, key steps I *must* include in my solution. The catch? These landmarks are in a specific order, and I can't just shuffle them around. I need to build a plan that incorporates *all* these landmarks, *in the exact sequence* given. The "feasible order" of the landmarks means it *should* be possible, but it's proving tricky.

The problem involves moving packages between cities using trucks and an airplane. I need to make sure the right packages end up at the right locations. I'm focusing on the initial setup: where the trucks are, where the airplane is, and, most importantly, where all the packages are. I've meticulously listed their starting points and their destinations. I know that packages already at their destinations don't need my attention, so I've quickly dealt with those.

My first thought is to break down the task, using trucks for moving things *within* a city, the airplane for *between* cities, and trucks again for the final delivery. My initial instinct is to move all packages that are in the same city to an airport, then fly the packages out. But this is where the landmark order comes in and makes things complex.

I'm analyzing the landmarks – starting with some straightforward "load a package onto a truck" actions. My problem is that some of the earlier steps seem to *require* preconditions that can only be met by actions appearing later in the list. For example, I have a landmark to load a package (p8) into a truck (t0) at a certain location. But, looking at the goal for p8 (l0-2), it is clear that p8 must come from l2-2 (city c2). This means that to load `p8` into t0, I need it to be unloaded from t2 and flown. And this sequence of actions: `unload-p8`, `load airplane-p8`, `fly`, `unload`, all the landmark actions (airplane related for `p8`) which seem to come *later* in the landmarks list.
Herein lies the crux.

I must keep *all* the landmarks and execute them in the given order. So, I will proceed with the strict execution of those. Since I cannot reorder the landmarks for different objects (p6, p8, p14, p15), I need to fill in all the *non-landmark* steps to set things up. It might look a little redundant, with the same actions appearing twice (once to satisfy a precondition and then again as a landmark). But it is my only option to stay consistent.

Essentially, I am forced to use airplane to move packages, *prior* to reaching the landmark `(load-truck p8 t0 l0-0)`, to get `p8` to the necessary location. This means, as I analyze the landmarks, I also have to generate non-landmark actions, especially actions to satisfy the preconditons. This also creates a longer overall plan.
