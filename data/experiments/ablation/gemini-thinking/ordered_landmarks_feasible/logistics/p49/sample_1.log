**Plan Generation Strategy for Logistics Instance**

My task is to create a PDDL plan for a logistics instance, given the domain and instance files, and importantly, a set of "action landmarks." These landmarks represent critical actions that *must* be included in any valid plan, and they are provided in a feasible order. The challenge lies in interpreting the significance of these landmarks, especially when they seemingly conflict or pertain to the same object at different stages.

First, I analyze the initial and goal states.  The goal involves delivering numerous packages to various locations, scattered across cities. The initial state includes airplanes, trucks, packages, and their starting locations.  The core actions are loading, unloading, driving trucks, and flying airplanes.

The key to plan generation is the landmark set.  I must ensure that the landmarks are included in a valid order with any necessary intermediate steps.  Initially, I thought landmarks were a sequential plan and attempted to process them strictly sequentially, adding pre-requisite actions (e.g., `drive-truck`, `fly-airplane`) as needed. This approach proved problematic as later landmarks, for the same object, contradicted earlier actions.

I realized that the "feasible order" of landmarks does not imply a strict chronological plan for each individual package.  Instead, I must interpret this order *globally*, meaning landmarks for each object are presented in an order that *could* be implemented in a valid plan.  There may be multiple paths for the same object, but my solution must *include all the landmarks*.

My core approach is to, for each landmark, satisfy its prerequisites by inserting auxiliary actions (like `drive-truck`, `fly-airplane`, and `unload/load`) as needed.  I also have to manage the fact that packages can move between trucks, and air planes.  I must also account for intermediate transfers.

I maintain a current state of objects, tracking their locations (`at_obj`), and whether they are loaded on a carrier (`in_obj`, vehicle such as a truck or airplane).  A supporting map, `loc_city`, provides the city associated to a location.

My main logic is: for a given landmark, identify all the prerequisites.  The main `transfer_object_to_location` function is essential, creating sub-plans as needed to move packages:

1.  If the object is not at the location specified in the landmark, I generate the steps to move the package there. For cross-city moves, the strategy involves unloading the package at the current cityâ€™s airport, loading it on an airplane, flying to the target city's airport, and unloading it. If the final load destination is a non-airport, I move to target location by a truck, if available.
2.  If the carrier and package are not at the same place, and the landmark needs them at that location, I will have to perform actions of transfer.
3. Once all conditions are met, I append the landmark action to the plan and update the current state.

At the end, I scan the plan, and make sure all packages are in their goal locations.  This is done, with the final cleanup.

This iterative process of ensuring all prerequisites are met creates a plan that includes all the required landmarks in a feasible, though not necessarily optimal, sequence, and I will be confident that this solution satisfies the requirements.  If multiple truck landmarks are specified, the earlier actions for an object are assumed to load and unload actions to transport the item. This generates complete, but perhaps inefficient, PDDL plans.
