**Okay, here's my plan to tackle this logistics problem.  I've got a PDDL domain and instance, plus a list of "landmarks" (required actions).  My goal is to create a complete plan, using the landmarks as a guide, knowing they must be *in* the plan.**

I'm an expert in this, so I know the problem. The domain defines packages, trucks, airplanes, locations, and cities.  We've got actions like loading/unloading trucks/airplanes and driving/flying between locations.  The instance gives us the initial state and the goal: get all the packages to their destinations.

The real challenge is these "landmarks."  They're specific actions that *must* be part of the final plan, *and* they're in a specific "feasible order." This means there *must* be a valid plan that follows their order, possibly with extra actions added.  This is what sets the constraint.

I'm thinking this means I need to "build" the plan step-by-step, taking each landmark in order and adding the necessary actions before it to make it *possible*.

I'll start by analyzing the current state (where everything is) and then the landmarks.  Each landmark is an action like "load package p3 onto truck t0 at location l0-0". If the preconditions of the landmark (package *and* truck at the same location) aren't met, I'll need to *insert* actions to move things around until those preconditions are true.

Here's where things get tricky, especially with packages that seem to require a lot of back-and-forth.

For example, I see `(load-truck p3 t0 l0-0)` and then later in a list `(load-truck p3 t1 l1-2)`.  That's impossible! One package can't be loaded on truck T0 and at the *same time* loaded on a different truck, right? Well, unless they are unloaded, moved, and then loaded. This means I must move the package, as required by the landmarks, from an area `l0-0` to `l1-2` and *then* get loaded again. It is inefficient but I must do so since it meets "feasible order".

To make sure I keep all this straight, I'll track the "at" (location) and "in" (truck/airplane) status of all objects.

**My Plan will now be generated and will then be followed by these steps:**

1.  **Iterate** through the landmark list, considering each landmark one by one.
2.  **Check** that each landmark is in the correct locations (preconditions).
3.  **If needed**, add actions to bring everything to the place before the landmark. I'll need to bring trucks and packages to the right places.  I'll need to do it as fast and efficient as possible for the transport.
4.  **Add** the landmark action.
5.  **Update** my state-tracking (where everything *now* is).

I think with this method, I can create a complete and valid plan!
