**Blocksworld Planning with Landmarks: A Step-by-Step Analysis**

Alright, let's craft a plan for this blocksworld instance. We've got our initial state, goal state (as 'on' predicates), and a set of ordered action landmarks. The objective is to efficiently incorporate these landmarks while meeting all the final stacking requirements.

First, I've defined the current state with all the initial predicates. Then, I'll go through each landmark, verifying its preconditions and then applying it to the current state. Any need for the arm to be free is addressed by placing blocks on table. Each action will modify the 'current_state' set and then be appended to 'plan'. The approach ensures the correct implementation of the given landmarks.

Unstacking will be performed first on a block to its under block. After removing all the necessary blocks from one another, pick up action is performed to achieve stack actions, to make necessary combinations that fulfill our goals.

For example:
First landmark is, `unstack b16 b22`.  Preconditions are all true, so apply the unstack operation, remove predicates regarding the blocks' states and change current state predicates. This process will continue until all the landmarks are taken care of and all blocks have been removed from the start point and added to the table. After this, a stack operation is done. During this process, I made sure all blocks will go to its place.

Finally, a `plan` is assembled based on the operations, and any pickup and putdown actions are included.

All the preconditions are satisfied at all steps. This will make the plan complete and valid based on the landmark order and necessary intermediate actions. All the conditions for all actions seem to be valid. The blocks are in the desired order.
