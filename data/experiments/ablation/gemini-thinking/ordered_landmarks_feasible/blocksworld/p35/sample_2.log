**Blocksworld Planning: A Comprehensive Strategy**

My primary goal is to generate a PDDL plan for the given Blocksworld instance.  I'm approaching this by leveraging the provided domain, the specific instance data, and, crucially, the "action landmarks." These landmarks, presented in a feasible order, guide my planning process. My core strategy is to adhere to this order as closely as possible, introducing any necessary auxiliary actions to satisfy the prerequisites for each landmark.

**Understanding the Problem:**

First, I need to understand the initial state, a complex configuration of blocks stacked in various ways. I need to know the initial `(arm-empty)` predicate, along with the `(on X Y)` and `(on-table X)` facts, as well as the initial `(clear X)` facts.

Secondly, the desired *goal state* is a rearranged configuration of the blocks. I need to build a plan to move the blocks from their initial state to this goal state.

**Planning Strategy:**

The core of my approach involves analyzing and processing the action landmarks provided. I break this down into these steps:

1.  **Analyze each Landmark:** I'll begin by analyzing the preconditions for each landmark action.

2.  **Addressing Precondition Issues:** If a landmark's preconditions are not met in the current state, I will need to introduce auxiliary actions. In this Blocksworld context, these auxiliary actions are typically `pickup` and `putdown` actions. For instance, if a block needs to be picked up, and it has another block on top, I'll need to first *unstack* that top block.

3.  **Iterative Refinement:** I follow this iterative refinement pattern until all the landmark actions, along with necessary auxiliary actions, are arranged into a plan to successfully change the state.

I'm starting by unstacking the initial blocks to ensure that I clear the blocks required for the `stack` actions. The `stack` actions will move them to their final positions.

Let's begin.

**Execution of the Plan:**

Following this methodology, and after iterating through each landmark, I generated a detailed plan. The plan is constructed by analyzing each landmark, introducing `putdown` and `pickup` operations as necessary. For simplicity, all blocks initially on the initial blocks will first be putdown, then picked up and stacked. This generates the following plan:

2.  (putdown b25)
