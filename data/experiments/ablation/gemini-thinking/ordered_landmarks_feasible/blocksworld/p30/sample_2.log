**Fulfilling the Blocksworld Plan**

Okay, I've got a blocksworld problem: given an initial setup of blocks and a desired final arrangement, plus a helpful set of "landmarks" (essential steps), my job is to create a step-by-step plan using the PDDL planning language. I'm focusing on "unstack" and "stack" actions: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, `unstack`.

First, I need to understand the initial and goal states, focusing on which blocks are *on* which others (the `on` predicates). The landmarks provide the roadmap â€“ I'll execute them in the given order.

The key is maintaining a "clear" state for blocks, so I can stack one on another. I need to make sure the "unstack" actions free up blocks, putting them on the table so they can be stacked later. I've realized many "putdown" actions are needed between unstack actions, and then "pickup" actions before stack. My general approach will be to execute each landmark, ensuring any preconditions like "arm-empty" and the necessary blocks being held or clear are true. I will check clear blocks to be sure the intermediate states are valid, using the landmark set and ordering as a guide.

I broke down a sequence of "unstack" actions. For this particular instance, they're ordered such that I "clear" blocks from the top down.

The sequence of blocks to move is:
b2 b7
b7 b13
b13 b5
b5 b14
b14 b10
b10 b19
b19 b23
b23 b11
b11 b3
b3 b8
b8 b6

After this clearing, there's a sequence of blocks that are stacked:
b4 b12
b12 b17
b17 b18
b18 b21
b21 b9
b9 b25
b25 b22
b22 b16
b16 b15
b15 b20
b20 b24

At this point, the stack clearing is complete, and the focus moves to re-stacking.

Re-checking for initial conditions, the table has b1, b6, b24 on it. The remaining blocks are on table by the sequence.
*   b1 (Initially on table and clear)
*   b6 (Initially on table)
*   b24 (Initially on table)
*   b2 b3
*   b4 b13
*   b5 b20
*   b7 b1
*   b8 b12
*   b10 b18
*   b15 b11
*   b16 b25
*   b17 b14
*   b19 b23
*   b21 b9
*   b22 b8

These blocks need to be stacked so that the final state is:
b1 b15
b2 b3
b3 b7
b4 b13
b5 b20
b7 b1
b8 b12
b10 b18
b12 b17
b13 b25
b14 b19
b15 b11
b17 b14
b20 b6
b21 b9
b22 b8
b24 b21
b25 b16

The plan will now focus on the re-stacking action landmarks, and other relevant actions to make the goal true.

This problem requires insertion to reach a goal state that the landmarks did not explicitly plan for. The crucial insight is that the goal demands that I stack a block *not* within the initial set of landmarks.  Thus, I determined that I have to build the final stack for `(on b12 b17)` *before* `(on b17 b14)`. It requires me to insert a missing `stack` action into the landmark order. This requires more flexibility, to ensure the intermediate states and goals match.

In short, there must be a valid sequence of `stack` actions that make the goal state true, while including all landmarks and *adding* a few extra necessary steps. The new step has `(stack b12 b17)` inserted.

The final action order will look like this:

    *   UNSTACK
    *   PUTDOWN
    *   PICKUP and STACK for the re-stack (based on landmarks)
    *   b12 stack
    *   b
