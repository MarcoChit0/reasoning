**The Mind of a Planner**

Okay, here's what I'm thinking. I'm given a Blocksworld problem - an initial state and a goal state, along with some suggested action "landmarks" I should try to follow. My job is to craft a valid PDDL plan, which means a sequence of actions that transforms the initial state into the goal state.  I need to make sure each action's preconditions are met before it's executed, and that the action's effects correctly update the state.  I also need to ensure the landmark actions are included and performed in the recommended order when possible.

First, I looked at the goal state and initial state to get a handle on what needs to be done. It's clear that blocks need to be moved around to satisfy the final "on" relationships. Then, I analyzed the action landmarks. They are basically a rough guide, directing the overall build sequence.

I identified potential conflicts within the initial state. For instance, if a block is on another block, it might not also be "clear." So I went through the initial "clear" predicates very carefully.

My strategy? Generally, it's best to clear the table, then build the desired stack structure. I meticulously went through the landmarks, which mostly involved moving things to table and then later taking blocks from the table and building.

This means a sequence of "unstack" and "putdown" actions is required. I inserted these intermediate actions to maintain validity of the plan. Then, when I needed to build up, I would pickup a block and stack it.

In fact, after putting all blocks to table and clearing them, my plan is ready to start building. I've broken the overall plan generation into a very granular approach, to maintain overall correctness.
I checked that each of the landmarks' preconditions was met before each action.
And I've double checked that the final plan satisfies all the goal conditions.
Now, the plan is good to go, I am done.
