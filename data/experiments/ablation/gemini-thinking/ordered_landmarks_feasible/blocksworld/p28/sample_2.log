**Initial Plan Formulation for Blocksworld Instance**

Okay, so I'm presented with a Blocksworld problem. My objective is to generate a PDDL plan, and I'm given "action landmarks" â€“ actions that *must* be included in any feasible plan. The key here is to follow the landmarks in their provided order while ensuring the preconditions for each action are met. I can strategically insert 'pickup' and 'putdown' actions (or even other 'unstack'/'stack' actions) to facilitate the landmarks, but I can't change their order.

Here's the approach I'm taking: I will begin with the initial state and iteratively process each landmark. For each landmark, I will carefully examine its preconditions. If the preconditions aren't satisfied, I'll insert any required actions *before* the landmark to ensure they are true, updating the state accordingly. After processing all landmarks, I'll need to confirm that the final goal conditions have been met. If not, it could mean the landmarks are incomplete or, more likely, a contradiction exists.

I've carefully examined the initial state and goal condition, and I need to be extra cautious about "static goals" like (on b11 b13), which are true initially and must remain true. Also, I've noted that certain stacks require actions that might conflict with other static goals. In a normal plan, it would be possible to insert or make actions to help achieve a goal, or to unstack, but this isn't the case in the Blocksworld scenario I have.

Here are the landmarks that I'll be working with. I'm noting the problem is the (on b11 b13) goal because the landmarks cause this condition to be broken. I'll insert extra actions if necessary:

*   Unstack everything so blocks are clear.
*   Stack, using intermediate actions.

Now, let's execute the plan. I'll execute all the operations in order, adding intermediate actions, and seeing what the result looks like.
