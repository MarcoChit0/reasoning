**Plan Generation for Blocksworld Instance**

Okay, so I'm presented with a blocksworld instance and need to create a valid PDDL plan to reach a given goal state. I've got the domain and instance files, plus a feasible order of action landmarks. My task is to generate a plan that includes these landmarks and, crucially, satisfies the goal conditions.

The goal is a set of "on" predicates specifying the final arrangement of the blocks. I'll need to work backward from this. The initial state and the provided landmark order are my guide.

I'm thinking, my general approach is this: I will take the action landmarks, then simulate the state changes they would cause, inserting "pickup" and "putdown" actions as needed to enable each landmark, and make sure the preconditions for each action are met.
I can then identify any other action landmarks that need to be performed. At each step, I will be adding `pickup` and `putdown` actions to make it so that the state of the problem will change, and all the preconditions needed for the landmarks are satisfied. The landmarks themselves should create states closer to the goal.

The biggest challenge I'm seeing now is the handling of contradictions.
A critical observation is the goal state and the given landmark sequence. There's a potential contradiction that I see with (on b19 b3) as a goal fact and the landmarks `unstack b19 b3` then `stack b16 b19`.

As it stands, (on b19 b3) would seem impossible. Either the goal is wrong, or the landmark order is wrong. But I can't touch either, so I must take them as they are and proceed. I will generate a valid plan and hope for the best.

After generating this plan, I now need to add any "simple" facts that are missing.
