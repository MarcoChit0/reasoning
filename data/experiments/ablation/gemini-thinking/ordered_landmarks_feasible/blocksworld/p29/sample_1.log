**Plan Generation for Blocksworld Instance**

Alright, let's break down how I'm tackling this PDDL planning problem. My goal is to craft a plan to rearrange the blocks from a starting configuration to a target goal state. I'm using the provided action landmarks as a roadmap; these landmarks guarantee a workable sequence of actions.

Here's my thought process: I start by visualizing the initial state and the desired final state. Then, I treat the landmarks as guideposts. For each landmark action, I check its preconditions and apply the action if they are true. If not, I insert auxiliary actions (pickup, putdown) to get the preconditions met. In the unstacking phase, I prioritize clearing the decks - that means I put blocks on the table.

Now, because `(on b18 b17)` is an initial and goal state I will insert `(stack b18 b17)`. The action `(unstack b18 b17)` will be used. Then after `(putdown b18)` I will pickup b18, stack it on b17, so that (on b18 b17) is a valid goal.

The approach looks at each landmark, and if a "clear" precondition is not met, a "putdown" or a "pickup" is applied. This methodology ensures I stay on track. This lets me determine what actions are needed to meet its preconditions and then insert them, following each landmark action. The plan is generated with all these checks.
