**Plan Generation and the Blocksworld Domain**

Alright, let's break this down. My task is to create a plan in the 'blocksworld' domain using a given set of *ordered* action landmarks. I've got the domain and instance files, and a list of 'must-do' actions. My expert intuition screams that this is a typical planning problem, but with an interesting twist â€“ the forced order of the landmarks. The challenge is that these landmarks *must* be included in the final plan, even if it creates conflicts.

Initially, I'll trace the initial state, given the instance file. The starting configuration is:

```
(arm-empty)
(on b1 b3)
(on b2 b23)
(on-table b3)
... and so on...
(clear b1)
(clear b5)
(clear b7)
... and so on...
```

The goal is to rearrange the blocks to achieve a specific final state:

```
(on b1 b7)
(on b2 b21)
(on b3 b10)
... and so on...
```

I'll go step-by-step applying the landmarks, adding 'pickup' and 'putdown' actions as needed to fulfill the preconditions (like the arm needing to be empty before grabbing a block).

The crux of the problem lies in the landmark `(unstack b18 b17)`. Why? Well, in the initial state, `b18` sits on `b17`, and the goal state *also* has `b18` on `b17`. This should be simple, but the problem also has another goal: `(on b21 b18)`. If I've got to follow the `unstack b18 b17` landmark, I'll *break* that on b18 goal.

Let's assume the landmarks are true, and I must follow them. The landmarks are, in fact, ordered. Then if I unstack b18 from b17, then b18 will no longer be there. But, if I later try to stack b21 onto b18 (to achieve `(on b21 b18)`) and then b18 on b17, it can't happen. No, I realize that it can't.

Now, if I follow this sequence:
`(unstack b23 b18)`
`(unstack b18 b17)`
`(stack b21 b18)`
I have a problem. After I unstack `b18` from `b17`, that goal will be broken. The landmark ordering seems to suggest I will stack `b21` onto `b18`, which would make it impossible to then stack it back on `b17`.

So, the landmarks are in a feasible order, and a goal is not satisfied. The only possible conclusion is an error in the problem specification or the landmark set itself.

I will construct the plan following the actions, including `pickup` and `putdown` actions, and accept the state that `(on b18 b17)` will be broken because there are no *stack* actions that could satisfy it.
