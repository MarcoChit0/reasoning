**A Detailed PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, let's craft this plan.  I'm given an initial state, a goal state, a domain, and a pre-defined sequence of actions (landmarks) in a blocksworld instance. My primary goal is to generate a valid plan that ensures all landmarks are executed in order, all goal states are met and the problem instance is satisfied.

First, I need to represent the initial and final states. The blocks, their on-relationships, and the `arm-empty` status define the start.  The final state, with all blocks stacked according to the specific configuration, is the target.

Then, comes the hard part. The plan will primarily be an sequence of `unstack` and `stack` operations, interspersed with `pickup` and `putdown`. The pre-defined landmark sequence dictates the structure.  My strategy is to *follow* that sequence closely, inserting auxiliary actions only as needed to satisfy preconditions. This involves, at minimum, making sure the arm is empty (`arm-empty`) before picking up or unstacking and ensuring the correct blocks are clear.

A critical observation is the long unstacking sequence at the beginning, almost like a "clear the table" phase, so that's where I'll begin. After this unstacking, the stacking process will begin, following the pre-defined sequence, inserting `pickup` and `putdown` as needed to make sure all preconditions are met.

As a reminder, if I'm currently holding a block, and the next `unstack` or `stack` action requires me to have an empty arm, I will immediately `putdown` the block. Furthermore, during stacking operations, it is necessary to pick up the block if it is on the table, and put down the block when stacking it.

Essentially, I will perform all the actions. I will start by unloading all the blocks, and then use the landmarks to create the plan! This requires the plan to look like this:

    *  Unstack sequence, with putdowns to table
    *  Pickup + Stacking Landmark
    *  Pickup + Stacking Landmark
    *  ...and so on...

At the end, I need to confirm that my generated plan truly does achieve the goal by verifying each step against both pre- and post-conditions.

I'm checking that any block being stacked has a clear base.

Furthermore, it is useful to check that:
*   Clear/on-table blocks are correct with `putdown` or unstacking.
*   Make sure all goals are present in some plan.

The last part of my mental modeling is the final state which must also include `(on b15 b18)`.
And that's the plan. Let's get to it!
