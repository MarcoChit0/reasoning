**Blocksworld Plan Generation with Landmarks**

My objective is to construct a PDDL plan for a given blocksworld instance.  This involves generating a sequence of actions that transforms the initial state into the desired goal state. The challenge is to respect the order of the provided action landmarks, which are guaranteed to be feasible. I need to figure out the intermediate actions required to create a plan that works.

Firstly, I analyze the initial and goal states.  I then break down the problem by considering each landmark action in the provided sequence.   The unstacking landmarks are clear, so I create an unstack -> putdown pattern of actions. This will get all blocks onto the table. Then, I focus on the "stack" operations.  I interpret the landmarks as mandatory actions that *must* be performed in the given sequence.

When the final state of the blockworld is clear, I start reassembling blocks to match the goal state.  I add `pickup` operations before each "stack" landmark to ensure the arm is empty, and the targeted block is clear and on the table.

One key challenge is ensuring that intermediate `stack` actions are inserted appropriately. For example, if I'm instructed to get block A on block B, but neither of those actions is a landmark, I must figure out the correct places for my intermediate action in the plan. I will check to see if each goal can be achieved. I check if `(on b15 b18)`, which is required by the problem's goal, could be true before landmark `stack b9 b15`. If not, I insert a `stack b15 b18` action.

So, for each landmark, I check the preconditions.  This process involves creating `(pickup A)` actions to prepare for a landmark and making sure actions are in the right order.

After analyzing the initial state, I build the plan iteratively. I ensure all goal conditions are met, all landmarks are correctly placed and the landmark order is respected. I verify that the plan satisfies all goal conditions and that the plan is valid, with all preconditions satisfied.
