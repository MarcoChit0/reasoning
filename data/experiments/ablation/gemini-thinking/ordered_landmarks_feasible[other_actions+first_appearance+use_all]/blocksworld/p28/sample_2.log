**A Detailed Plan for Blocksworld**

Okay, so I'm tasked with creating a PDDL plan for this blocksworld problem. The core of the challenge is that the plan *must* respect the order of the provided action landmarks, and I can assume the landmarks are presented in a feasible sequence.

My initial approach is to break this down into steps: first, understand the initial and goal states. Then, dissect the landmarks and see what they tell me about the required stack construction.

The landmarks suggest a strategy: unstack all blocks to get them clear, then build the target stacks using the given landmark order. This feels right because many unstack actions require the block above to be clear.

So, the plan looks like this:

1.  **Unstacking Phase:** Iterate through the unstack landmarks and make sure all blocks are cleared off of target blocks, put the intermediate blocks on the table, and make certain all conditions are true for the unstack action.

    For each `(unstack ?ob ?underob)` landmark, I'll need to insert `putdown` actions as needed *before* each landmark.

2.  **Stacking Phase:** Once everything is clear, I'll implement the stack landmarks, inserting `pickup` actions as necessary to bring blocks into the gripper.

3.  **Ensure All Goals are Achieved:** After executing the unstacking and stacking landmark actions, I have to ensure all the final goals are met. If I find any goal isn't achieved, I'll insert any non-landmark actions required to finish that goal.

So, to summarize: the plan will be based on strictly following the landmarks while ensuring the preconditions are met and all goal conditions are true. This should create an efficient, complete plan.
