**Plan Generation for Blocksworld Instance**

Alright, let's dive into this blocksworld problem. I need to figure out a plan, in PDDL, that gets us from the initial jumble of blocks to the specific goal configuration.  The catch?  I need to follow the provided action landmarks in order. That's the core challenge. The plan needs to be valid, of course, meaning all the actions' preconditions are satisfied and the goal holds true at the end.

First, I break down the initial and goal states.  I've got the starting positions of all the blocks, including what's clear and what's on the table. The goal is all about stacking the blocks in a particular way â€“ all `(on ?x ?y)` facts, no blocks on the table.

Now, those landmarks.  They are a sequence of actions. I'll need to figure out how they fit together, making sure I add in any missing steps. I know my strategy: Unstack everything, clear out the workspace, and then re-stack according to the goal.

Starting with the landmarks, I walk through each one, simulating the state changes. If I need to pick something up, I make sure the arm is empty, and then if needed, I put something down. For example if I'm doing `(unstack b16 b17)`, I will move b16 to table, then `(putdown b16)`. The unstack landmarks start the process of clearing and moving blocks around. Then after those, there are `stack` landmarks, so I use the pick up landmarks and stack them again to achieve the goal state.

The trick is making sure everything is clear, that the arm is free when needed, and that I'm taking the landmarks in order. I'm adding `pickup` and `putdown` actions to make sure everything's lined up.

There's one snag. The goal state requires `(on b11 b13)`, but that's not explicitly in the landmarks. I can't break the order of landmarks given, but I must also achieve the goal state. So, I need to insert  a missing `(stack b11 b13)` action, given that b11, b13 must be on the table. By inserting this stack action in the correct place in the sequence, I can be certain this step is achieved and valid.

With that, I've constructed a full PDDL plan, which should correctly manipulate the blocks to achieve the goal state, respecting the action landmarks order, all preconditions, and state. The plan is constructed by first generating a `putdown` and `unstack` section, and then a `pickup` and `stack` sequence which I had to augment with a stacking action to achieve the goal state, following the rules and specifications exactly.
