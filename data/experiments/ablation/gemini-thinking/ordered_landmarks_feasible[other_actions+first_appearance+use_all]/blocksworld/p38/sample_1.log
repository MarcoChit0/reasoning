**Blocksworld Planning with Landmarks: A Strategy**

My primary goal is to generate a PDDL plan for a complex blocksworld instance.  I'm given a sequence of "action landmarks," which are crucial operations that *must* appear in the plan, and their order must be respected *for their first occurrence*. These landmarks are essentially guideposts in the planning process.

The strategy that makes the most sense is: first, dismantle the initial state into a "clear table" state (all blocks on the table, no stacks).  Second, build the goal state stacks using the "stacking" landmarks and intermediate steps like putting down blocks. 

I'm facing a few critical challenges:

1.  **Ensuring Correct Landmark Ordering:** The landmarks aren't just suggestions; they define a sequence that *must* be adhered to. I need to figure out where those non-landmark actions should go. 
2.  **Handling Conflicts:** There's a potential contradiction in the goal state.  It states that two blocks should be directly on top of the same block, which is logically impossible in the standard blocksworld.  I must make an interpretation to resolve this, which is most likely an initial state oversight.
3.  **Intermediate Operations:** I must insert intermediate `pickup` and `putdown` actions to satisfy the preconditions and effects of the landmarks.  I will insert putdowns after the unstacking to keep the arm empty when I put down bocks, and pick them up again when they are the stack base.

Here's my general plan structure:

1.  **Unstacking Phase:** Process all the `unstack` landmarks in the given order. For each, pick up the top block (if needed), execute the unstack action, and *then put it down on the table*.  This clears blocks for subsequent stacks.
2.  **Stacking Phase:** Proceed through the `stack` landmarks, executing them in order. Make sure to `pickup` any block that needs to be held. After, insert the blocks that do need to be restacked, in order. The goal state has these explicit states, but are not in the provided stack sequence, which is why I need to take care.
3.  **Address goals and Non-Landmark Stacks** (Goal Stack Operations): I also need to make stacks for (on x y) that have no landmarks.

I'll proceed landmark by landmark, crafting the plan step-by-step to include these custom actions, where appropriate:

*   First, `unstack` all the blocks, putting each down after unstacking.
*   Next, `stack` all stacks based on landmarks.
*   Then add non-landmark stacking actions to ensure that all required goal states are met.
*   And finally address the conflict.
