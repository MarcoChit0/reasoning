**Reflecting on the PDDL Planning Process**

Okay, so I've been given a Blocksworld instance and I need to generate a PDDL plan.  My task is to take these "action landmarks" and create a valid plan that achieves the goal state while respecting the order specified by the landmarks. The core of this seems to be unstacking blocks to clear the workspace, and then restacking them to reach the goal state.  It's like a puzzle!

The initial state, with all the blocks stacked up, screams for an unstacking phase. It makes sense, from my experience, that the landmarks are guiding a good strategy, like a roadmap. I'm going to follow each landmark, making sure the preconditions are satisfied before each action. If the arm is holding a block (because I've just "unstacked" or "picked up") before an unstack, I'll need a putdown action. The `arm-empty` and `clear` predicates are important and need to be dealt with consistently.

So, I start by tracking the changes after each action. The landmarks are processed in order and each time I need to ensure if the pre-requisite conditions are fulfilled. If not, I am including intermediate actions for handling the pre-requisites.

I'm thinking that after all the unstack actions, most blocks will be on the table. This should simplify the problem. I'll need to focus on stacking the blocks in the right order.

During the stacking phase, I'll be picking up the blocks and stacking them following the goal and the landmark order.

In essence, the plan I'm formulating will be a structured sequence of actions. In this Blocksworld problem, I'm expecting this plan to solve the problem systematically, by first clearing the work area and then rebuilding the stacks, all while following the roadmap of the provided action landmarks.
