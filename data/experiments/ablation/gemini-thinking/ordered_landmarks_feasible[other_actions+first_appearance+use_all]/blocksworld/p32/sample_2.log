**The Puzzle and the Plan: A Deep Dive**

Okay, so I've got this blocksworld problem. The goal is clear: I need a PDDL plan to rearrange these blocks into specific stacks, as defined in the goal state. The catch? I'm given a set of "landmarks" - basically, crucial actions that *must* happen in a specific order. My task is to weave these landmark actions into a complete plan, figuring out any "helper" actions needed to make each landmark possible.

First, I analyzed the domain (blocksworld-4ops) and the actions at my disposal: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`. I checked the preconditions and effects for each, which is critical. Then, I dug into the goal. It boils down to creating three towers, basically: one tall tower, one medium tower, and a small tower. These towers define a series of `on` predicates that have to hold true for the plan to succeed.

The initial state gave me the block configuration. I needed to figure out which blocks were clear, on the table, etc. to evaluate if the preconditions of the landmarks were met.

The landmarks are crucial. I focused on them and worked backward. For each landmark, I asked: "Can this action happen right now?". If not, what needs to be done *beforehand*?

For `unstack` actions (which seem to be the majority in the landmarks), I looked for blocks that must be "free" first and worked back from those. I needed to perform actions on blocks to get them clear. In other words, to get certain blocks free and clear so that the landmarks can be performed. I had to build subplans between the landmarks. `Unstack` means taking things apart, which has a ripple effect. I used `putdown` actions to place blocks temporarily on the table, so they would be free, and then I kept building up towards what was necessary for the goal state. Each landmark's impact on the state had to be carefully assessed for dependencies.

In short: I've got a sequence of `unstack` operations. After each unstack, I had to `putdown` the block the arm was holding. I then looked at the resulting state to plan for the next action in the sequence. Each subsequent landmark could then happen as a sequence of operations based on the new conditions. `stack` had to follow the order as well, making sure all preconditions were met.

I essentially built up a series of subplans around each landmark operation so that the final state was a plan that met the goal.
