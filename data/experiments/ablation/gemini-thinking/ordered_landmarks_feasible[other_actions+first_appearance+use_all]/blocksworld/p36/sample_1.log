**My plan is to create a PDDL plan for this Blocksworld problem.** I have the domain, instance, and a sequence of "action landmarks" that guide the solution.  The challenge is that these landmarks aren't always directly executable because of preconditions. I need to insert additional actions, like *pickup*, *putdown*, *unstack*, and *stack*, to ensure these landmark actions can occur. The key is to respect the order of the provided landmarks for their *first* appearance in the plan.  I'll need to work through each landmark and ensure all prerequisites are met before attempting it.

I'm starting by analyzing the problem: the goal is a specific arrangement of blocks, and the initial state details their current positions. I know the available actions: *pickup*, *putdown*, *stack*, and *unstack*.  The action landmarks will provide a structured way to solve the problem.

The plan generation will involve several steps.  First, I'll need to *unstack* blocks to free up others on top and also make them on the table (clear).  I'll then be able to *stack* the blocks in the target configurations, by following the *landmark* sequence. I must maintain a current 'state' map with a clear picture of the predicates that are *true*.

I've traced the landmarks step-by-step, inserting *putdown* actions to put down an object that is currently held, when the preconditions for stack are not met. The plan trace carefully keeps a record of the *clear* predicate. I also note an unexpected addition to the list of commands: *stack b20 b4*.  I will make sure to satisfy the stack predicate when generating plan for all blocksworld instances.
