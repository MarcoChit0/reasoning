**Final PDDL Plan for the Blocksworld Instance**

Okay, here's the plan I've meticulously crafted. My primary objective is to get the blocks arranged as the goals state, making sure to stick to the order of the actions provided as landmarks.

I started by looking at the initial state and goal state of this blocksworld instance. It was pretty clear that there'd be some initial configurations to work around. The initial analysis revealed a whole bunch of blocks that had to be unstuck. That was the first hurdle. The goal is to set the blocks in the desired 'on' configurations.

The crux of my strategy here is a careful blend of unstacking and restacking operations. This plan has two distinct phases. I took each action landmark, broke it down, then worked backwards to make sure all of its precondions were valid by considering any actions that had to happen before each landmark.

**Phase 1: Unstacking**

The first phase is "Unstacking." I'll move a bunch of the blocks from various stacks. I'll need to remove each block that is currently in a way from a final block arrangement. To achieve this, I start at the top of several stacks, one by one. I use the "unstack" action to take a block off a block. It requires that the top block is clear, and the arm is empty. After an `unstack` action, I always have to perform a corresponding `putdown`.

**Phase 2: Stacking**

This is the second phase. Now that most of the blocks are on the table and clear, I'll go through the landmarks and use the "stack" action, and "pickup". Note, the Stack action requires the two blocks (on and under) to be clear.

My main challenge was to make sure that the order of the landmarks worked with the constraints. These landmarks are crucial actions. The plan involves the sequence of the actions, along with additional `pickup` and `putdown` actions to make sure that all constraints in the actions are satisfied. There were some missing stacks to accomplish, but with the analysis, they became clear.

This plan should do the trick! Now to get it into PDDL format.
