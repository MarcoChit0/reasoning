**Blocksworld Plan Generation - Expert Perspective**

The task is to produce a PDDL plan for a given `blocksworld` instance. The core requirements are to satisfy all the specified goal conditions (e.g., specific blocks stacked on each other) and incorporate all provided action landmarks (e.g., `unstack`, `stack`) in their given order, without changing the problem or trying to achieve a simpler version.

The approach involves several stages. Initially, the goal conditions and the initial state of the world need to be understood. The given goals express `on` relations between blocks. The initial state gives us the current configuration.

I need to understand the initial state deeply. From the initial state, I can see that many blocks are stacked in incorrect configurations. To reach the goal, I need to clear the necessary blocks and create valid substacks and complete goals stacks as needed, using the landmark actions as guides, and making sure to follow all pre-conditions and post-conditions.

The process then boils down to:

1.  **Analyze and Process Landmarks:** Understand the initial state and how to reach the goals through the landmarks. It makes sense that the initial landmarks consist of `unstack` actions. The sequence of actions is the key for building the plan. For instance, `(unstack b2 b7)` - is easy to achieve: if blocks `b2` and `b7` are on the table and empty, then it can be easily done.
2.  **Add `pickup`/`putdown` Actions:** While building the plan, I need to make sure that each `stack` action is preceded by a `pickup` action of the appropriate block. And each `unstack` is followed by a `putdown`.
3.  **Insert Intermediate Steps:** Analyze the landmarks and insert intermediate `pickup`, and `stack` steps to resolve any sub-goals or build the final goal configuration as needed. Check for any conflicts with the initial state, or landmarks that require `clear`.

The most challenging area is reconciling initial conditions and landmarks. The landmark `unstack` actions, need careful attention to the pre-conditions, particularly those requiring `clear` and `on-table` predicates. One key problem lies with the block `b24`. In the initial state, it's mentioned as both `(on-table b24)` and `(on b20 b24)`. These contradict each other. I'll make the assumption that the `(on b20 b24)` state is correct, and thus the initial `(on-table b24)` must be false. Following the blocksworld assumptions, a block under another block is also on the table for our purposes.  The problem definition seems to require some inference from the problem itself.

The solution requires careful sequencing and insertion of actions. For the generated plan, this analysis requires a step-by-step interpretation of all the pre-conditions and post-conditions of each action. This helps in building the required and intermediate stacks and ensures that goals are achieved in accordance with the specified landmarks, while making sure the intermediate states are achievable. The final plan will generate the correct goals and is shown.
