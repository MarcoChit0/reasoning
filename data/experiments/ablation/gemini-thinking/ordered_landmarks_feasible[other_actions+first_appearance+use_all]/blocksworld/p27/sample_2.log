**A Detailed Walkthrough of PDDL Plan Generation**

Okay, here's how I'm approaching this planning problem in the `blocksworld` domain. My goal is to produce a valid PDDL plan that fulfills all the `on` relations specified in the goal state, while adhering to the imposed landmark constraints (i.e., making sure each landmark action appears in the specified order).

**Understanding the Terrain**

First, it's about grasping the rules of the game: my initial state contains blocks stacked up in various configurations, and the goal state outlines the *desired* final arrangement of these blocks. I'm given specific PDDL actions: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`. Each action has well-defined preconditions that must be met before it can be executed, as well as clear effects.  I have an arm that can either be empty or holding a single block.

**The Landmark Challenge**

The crux of the problem is the landmark order: I have to ensure that all the landmark actions (e.g., `unstack b13 b6`) occur in the exact sequence provided. Crucially, I'm allowed to insert additional actions *before* any landmark. This is where strategic thinking becomes crucial. For each landmark, I'll need to check if the conditions required for that landmark are actually satisfied in the current world state. If they aren't, I need to add actions to make them so.

**The Strategy Unfolds**

I'm tackling this step-by-step:
1. **Unstacking:**  My first strategy is to unstack all the blocks that are part of the initial towers. I'm doing so *exactly* in the landmark order. This sets the stage.
2. **Clear the Ground:** Because the stack actions require that the bottom block is 'clear', I have to ensure that the bottom block is clear before each stack.
3. **Rebuild the World:** Once I've addressed the landmark actions in the given order, the remaining goal `on` predicates need to be met. I'll need to make sure that the goal state has the configuration of blocks that the landmarks didn't specify.

**Deconstructing the Landmarks**

For each landmark, the process is:
1.  **Analyze Current State:** Understand what the state of the world *is* (e.g., blocks on table, block stackings, arm state, etc.)
2.  **Verify Preconditions:** Check the current state against the preconditions of the upcoming landmark. Are the required conditions true?
3.  **Intermediate Actions (if needed):** If the preconditions aren't met, insert actions to make them so (e.g., `putdown` the block the arm is holding and then `pickup` b12)
4.  **Execute Landmark:** Perform the landmark action to update the current state and record the effects.

**Iteration and refinement**

This process is repeated for each landmark. To complete the plan, I'll review and insert any actions required at the end. I'm carefully tracking the state of the world after each action.

**The Core Idea:** I am basically transforming the initial state to my desired world. I am first unstacking, then I will clear, then I will stack the blocks in a manner that ensures that I am respecting the landmark order. Then, I will address the rest of the goal.
