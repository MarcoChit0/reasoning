**Plan Synthesis and Goal Achievement**

Alright, as an expert in planning, I've got a PDDL instance here, a blocksworld problem if I've ever seen one. My task? Devise a plan – a sequence of actions – to transform the given *initial state* into the *goal state*, all while adhering to the provided *action landmarks*, which must be included and in their respective order. It's a classic puzzle, but the landmarks add a layer of constraint and guidance.

First thing, I've gotta understand the board. I've broken down the initial state to see which blocks sit atop one another, and also the goal state. I've got to find the difference.  The landmarks are the key – they suggest a unstack-and-stack strategy.

I'll start by systematically processing those landmarks. The unstack actions will be crucial for clearing the board and prepping the stacks, since no stack will be possible without making something clear first. With some analysis, I've been able to extract an important rule: blocks are unstacked to *clear space*, even when they are part of a target goal state. Then, I add necessary putdown action to prevent the "arm-empty" requirement from failing.

I've already begun to visualize how those blocks will be maneuvered. I predict that the initial unstacking phase will be followed by a strategic stacking phase, driven by the stack landmarks. The landmarks clearly guide the process.

Okay, I've identified two missing actions: (stack b2 b20) and (stack b6 b12). This wasn't obvious. I can't just follow the landmarks blindly. I need to fulfill all *goals* in the end, or the solution will be incomplete. They'll need to go after b20 is placed, and b6 after. I must insert those actions too. 

And, of course, pickup actions before each stack. This is straightforward.

With these extra steps, I've constructed a complete plan with unstacking, putting down blocks to the table, and correct stack ordering that achieves all the given blocksworld goals in the correct order as guided by the action landmarks, along with my two added action steps. A solid solution. Let's execute!
