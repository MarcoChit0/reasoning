**Blocksworld Planning: A Landmark-Guided Approach**

Alright, let's dive in. I'm given a blocksworld instance with a complex goal state and a pre-defined sequence of actions, or "landmarks," that should be included in the plan. The challenge here is to create a valid PDDL plan, ensuring all landmarks appear in the specified order and that the final state achieves the complex goal state.

My initial approach? First, understanding the goal and the initial state. The initial state is a jumbled mess of blocks, some stacked high, some on the table, and the arm is empty. The goal is clear: a set of "on" predicates describing the final stack arrangement. I can also visualize the complex sets of stacks.

Next, I'll take it piece by piece. I will track the current world state, which starts with an empty arm and a world state. I'll analyze each landmark.  The initial landmarks look like they're meant to "flatten" the stacks, which is a key approach to getting this done. I'll add intermediate actions as needed to maintain the preconditions for each action to be valid.

Basically, I will process each landmark action, `unstack` or `stack`.
For `unstack` operations, I need clear blocks and an empty arm as preconditions, which isn't always true. If not, I'll add `putdown` actions to make the needed preconditions true.

For `stack` operations, I need to make sure the target blocks are clear. Then, I need to pick up the stackable block and then stack it.
As I track the world state, I'll make sure each intermediate action is properly taken to satisfy the goals. 

With all that done, let's construct a plan that should accomplish the goal. This approach systematically breaks down the problem, makes sure it has the preconditions for the actions, and makes sure the landmarks are added. The final plan? All the actions, listed in order.
