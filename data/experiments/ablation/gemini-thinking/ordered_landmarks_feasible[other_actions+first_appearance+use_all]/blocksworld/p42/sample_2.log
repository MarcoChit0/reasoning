**Fulsome PDDL Plan Generation for Blocksworld**

As an expert in planning, I'm tasked with crafting a PDDL plan for this specific `blocksworld-4ops` instance, ensuring the prescribed landmark actions are executed in the correct order. My initial strategy involves a deep dive into the problem's structure: the initial and goal states, the defined landmarks, and the constraints of the blocksworld domain.

My approach is predicated on a fundamental understanding of blocksworld: to achieve the goal state, I need to methodically disassemble stacks, move individual blocks to free up space, and then meticulously reconstruct the target configuration. This requires a systematic breakdown of the process into three main steps: unstack, putdown, pickup and stack.

First, I interpret the sequence of landmarks as a blueprint, outlining critical steps. Most of these landmarks are of the form `(unstack ?ob ?underob)`.  I can see that a tower of blocks needs to be broken down. Since I need to respect the order of the unstack actions, I must carefully insert the putdown action.

Next, I need to putdown each block that is no longer needed to be held.  After an unstack action, I must insert the `putdown ?ob` action immediately to clear the arm, make the block accessible, and ensure subsequent actions can occur. This is where I have the putdown actions.

Then I work through the stack actions and insert pickup actions. Each time I have a `stack ?ob ?underob` action, I need to ensure the preconditions hold: the `?ob` block must be held in the arm and the `?underob` block must be clear. Since I am only holding blocks that were just taken from the table, I can insert `pickup ?ob` immediately before each `stack` operation.

Finally, I take the plan and check its validity. The plan meets all the needed preconditions.

By applying this strategic approach, combined with my extensive knowledge of planning techniques and blocksworld, I can generate a valid, optimal plan that achieves the desired outcome while adhering to all constraints.
