**Comprehensive Plan for Blocksworld Domain (4-ops)**

As an expert in planning, I'm tasked with generating a PDDL plan for a `blocksworld` domain problem. My goal is to create a valid plan that achieves a specific goal state while adhering to a given order of action landmarks as much as possible, inserting intermediate actions where necessary.

The problem utilizes the `blocksworld-4ops` domain, characterized by predicates like `clear`, `on-table`, `arm-empty`, `holding`, and `on`, along with fundamental actions: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`. The problem is defined by a complex goal state involving numerous stacks of blocks and an initial state detailing the starting configuration.

Given the goal state, which includes building several stacks (e.g., `(on b1 b20)`, `(on b2 b25)`, etc.), and the initial state, I've identified that this is a complex reordering problem. The key is to leverage the provided action landmarks which follow a typical "unstack everything" then "stack everything" pattern, common to blocksworld problems.  My strategy will be to meticulously execute the landmarks while ensuring all preconditions of each action are met by inserting intermediate actions, primarily "putdowns" of blocks that aren't immediately needed.

I've carefully analyzed the initial state, identifying clear blocks, blocks on the table, and the relationships between blocks to determine the state before applying the sequence of landmarks. I've also tracked the clear state of all blocks as the unstack actions are performed.

I've worked through each landmark, meticulously detailing the state changes after each action (including preconditions, effects). My plan uses each landmark and will be correct assuming that the preconditions of the `unstack`, `stack` are met. I've kept track of whether the `arm-empty` condition, the `on-table` and `clear` conditions are met for each state. `pickup` and `stack` will be used to meet stack preconditions, by putting things on tables or on top of clear objects. I am confident that my plan correctly reorders blocks and satisfies the goal configuration.
