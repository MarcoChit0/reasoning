**PDDL Planning for blocksworld-4ops**

I'm tasked with generating a PDDL plan for a `blocksworld` problem, given a domain file, an instance file, and a set of action landmarks in a feasible order. My approach involves understanding the domain's predicates and actions, the initial state, the goal state, and the landmarks' suggested order.

**Understanding the Domain:**

The `blocksworld-4ops` domain uses these key components:
*   **Predicates:** `clear`, `on-table`, `arm-empty`, `holding`, `on`.
*   **Actions:** `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, `unstack`.

The `unstack`/`stack` and `pickup`/`putdown` actions rely on preconditions such as `clear` blocks, `on-table` for `pickup`, and `arm-empty`. The landmark sequence guides the path towards the goal state, but I must ensure the preconditions for each action are met at every step.

**Plan Construction:**

1.  **Follow Landmarks with Precondition Enforcement:** I will process the landmark actions in the given order. If the landmark is `unstack` or `pickup`, I'll execute the associated action only if the preconditions are valid. If it's a `stack`, I'll *first* check if the arm is holding the correct block and `pickup` it if not.
2.  **Arm Management with Putdown Actions:**  After performing an `unstack` or `pickup`, if the arm is *not* empty, I will perform a `putdown` action to satisfy the preconditions of other actions. This is to guarantee the `arm-empty` predicate for the next actions.
3.  **Ensure Clear Preconditions:** The "feasible order" of landmarks implies that the landmark actions can be applied in the sequence as given. If a `clear` requirement is not met, I should put an action to meet the requirement. Since the landmarks are a good sequence of `unstack`, I only check clear preconditions on actions to determine if action can happen in the sequence. If the blocks are not immediately needed in `stack` landmark actions, I might `putdown` them and `pickup` them again later.

**My Plan - A Step-by-Step Approach:**

*   **Unstacking Phase:** Flatten the stacks by `unstacking` each block and immediately placing it `on-table` to clear the top and free up the arm. The correct block is moved to the table with a `putdown`.
*   **Building Phase:** Follow the landmarks using `pickup` and `stack` to correctly rebuild the goal state. If a stack action is encountered, I will perform a `pickup` first.

With this strategy, I carefully manage the state (keeping the arm empty when possible and clearing blocks) as the plan's actions are processed in the right order.

My detailed plan is a sequence of actions like the one that follows:

1.  `(unstack b13 b1)`
2.  `(putdown b13)`
3.  ...
4.  `(pickup b2)`
5.  `(stack b2 b20)`
6.  `(pickup b14)`
7.  `(stack b14 b2)`
8.  ...
9.  and so on.

The plan generated should be a valid plan since I am taking care to satisfy the action preconditions for all actions. I will check the correctness of the plan by simulating each action and verifying that all the `on`, `clear` predicates of the goal state are met.
