**Generating a PDDL Plan for the Blocksworld Instance**

Okay, here's my plan to tackle this blocksworld puzzle. The goal is to get all the blocks stacked in specific configurations, using the given action landmarks as a guide.  I'm dealing with a list of "on" relationships in both the initial and the goal states, plus which blocks are clear, and the available action landmarks in their pre-defined order. These landmarks are crucial as they define the backbone of the plan. I'll need to figure out how to get to the situations where these actions can occur, and then build around them.

First, I looked at the initial state and understood the goal: move blocks from their starting positions to their final goal positions as defined by the "on" relationships. I also made sure I understood the initial clear blocks as defined in the problem description, so I can start from those blocks which are clear. I'll need to figure out which blocks need to be "clear" to satisfy the preconditions of the actions.

The strategy is straightforward: work through the action landmarks one by one. For each action (which are all stacked on top of each other), I'll make sure its preconditions are met. If I'm holding a block that isn't the one I need, I'll put it down first.  If the block I need to manipulate isn't clear or I don't have it in my hand, I'll add the necessary "unstack," "pickup," and "putdown" actions to set things up. The action landmarks provide the target actions and I have to insert the required supporting actions.

I know that to unstack a block, I need to have an empty hand, the target block to unstack and its supporting block must be in the "on" relationship, and that the top block to be unstacked has to be clear. To stack, I need to have the target block held, and the target bottom block in clear state.  To pick up a block, I need a clear block and that block must be on the table, and my hand must be empty.

I'm keeping track of the current state and using a greedy approach, taking whatever step is immediately necessary to allow the current action landmark, then updating the state, and repeating. I'll keep doing this until I've processed every single landmark in the order that I was provided. Then, I will confirm whether all goal conditions are achieved in the new state.  And, finally, verify the plan is correct.  I'm confident this method, guided by the ordered landmarks, will generate a valid plan.
