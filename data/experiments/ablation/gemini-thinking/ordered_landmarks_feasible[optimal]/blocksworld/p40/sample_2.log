**Plan Generation for Blocksworld**

As an expert in planning, I'm presented with a blocksworld problem. My objective is to generate a PDDL plan, leveraging a domain file, an instance file, and a *feasibly ordered* set of action landmarks. These landmarks essentially dictate a feasible sequence of actions, which I must integrate into a complete plan.

My approach is systematic:

1.  **Initialization:** I begin by establishing the initial state of the blocksworld, based on the `:init` section of the instance file. This includes defining the initial `on` relationships (e.g., `(on b1 b2)`) and the blocks that are initially `clear` and on the table.

2.  **Iterative Landmark Processing:** I then iterate through the provided action landmarks, which guide the plan's structure. For each landmark, I meticulously check its preconditions, such as `clear`, `on`, and `arm-empty`.

3.  **Precondition Fulfillment:** If a landmark's preconditions aren't met in the current state, I utilize helper functions to generate additional actions to satisfy those preconditions. This involves determining the necessary actions for clearing blocks (using `unstack` and `putdown` actions) and for picking up and putting down blocks (using `pickup` and `putdown` actions, respectively).

4.  **State Evolution:** After adding each action to the plan, I update the internal representation of the state (using `on_map`, `clear_blocks`, `on_table_blocks`, `arm_empty`, and `holding` to efficiently track the changes, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

5.  **Plan Refinement:** The core of the plan generation lies in carefully adding the appropriate actions, ensuring all the preconditions for the action landmarks are met, and consistently updating the state to reflect the effect of the actions that I plan.

This methodology guarantees that the final plan is a logically sound and valid sequence of actions, transforming the initial state to the desired goal state.
