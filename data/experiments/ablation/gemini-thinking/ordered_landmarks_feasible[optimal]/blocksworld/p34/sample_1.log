**PDDL Plan Generation for a Blocksworld Instance**

Alright, let's craft a PDDL plan for this blocksworld problem. I've got the domain and instance files, plus a set of action landmarks to guide me. My goal is to transform the initial state into the desired goal state.

The key is to deconstruct the initial, extremely cluttered state. I know I'll need to unstack blocks to clear the workspace and make way for building the goal configurations. The crucial factor is the *clear* predicate. I'll need to meticulously track which blocks are clear at any given time.

I've carefully analyzed the initial state, identifying clear blocks: those with nothing on top. It looks like `b2`, `b4`, and `b9` are my starting points for unstacking.  I can infer other clear blocks as unstacking proceeds.

The landmarks are helpful, acting as a skeleton plan. However, the landmarks only list the *unstack* and *stack* actions. I need to insert `putdown` actions to temporarily place blocks on the table, and `pickup` actions, to pickup blocks from the table, to maintain the (arm-empty) and (holding) predicates to enable later actions. I have to make sure each block is available, clear, and on the table, before I pick it up.

So, the approach: First, I will execute a sequence of *unstack* and *putdown* actions in the correct order to free the stack from the initial configuration. Each block will be placed on the table to provide a clear surface for new stacking operations. Following this, I will add the *pickup* and *stack* operations to re-assemble the target towers.
I am using a systematic approach by generating the plan from the bottom of each goal tower to make sure all preconditions are met before calling each action. Also I should add the actions that were not available in the given landmarks, but required to achieve all the stated goals.

In total, it boils down to: unstacking everything, putting it on table, then reconstructing all stacks.
