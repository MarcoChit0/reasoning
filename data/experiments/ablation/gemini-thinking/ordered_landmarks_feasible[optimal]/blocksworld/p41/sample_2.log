**Pondering a PDDL Plan for the Blocksworld**

Okay, so the task at hand is to generate a PDDL plan for this blocksworld instance.  I've got the initial and goal states, and critically, a sequence of landmark actions to follow.  This means I need to execute those landmarks in order, but intelligently. I'm thinking I'll start with all the initial setup from the instance file (:init predicates).

The strategy is straightforward in theory:  go through each landmark action. If it's *already* possible (preconditions are true in the current state), great, just add it to the plan.  If not, I need to insert the necessary preparatory actions to make it possible. In blocksworld, this usually means picking up and putting down blocks.

The "putting down blocks" part before I can move the right block to the tower is the most complex aspect of this process. So: first, I'll need to check the preconditions of the landmark (what needs to be true *before* the action can be executed). If they are not met, I'll add the necessary "unstack," "pickup," and "putdown" actions. I need to make sure I *don't* violate any of the later landmarks.

I can initialize a table with initial state predicates: the arm being empty, and where blocks are stacked. Then, I keep checking the preconditions of a landmark. If needed, I add those `putdown` actions to the plan until my `arm-empty` is true. Then, it will always be followed by the `pickup` and the final `stack` actions that were landmarked. The stack and clear information must be tracked.

The process boils down to:

1.  **Initialize**:  Load the initial state.
2.  **Iterate**:  For each landmark:
    *   **Check**: Does the current state meet the preconditions?
    *   **Preconditions unmet**: Add putdown, pick up, unstack, until preconditions are satisfied.
    *   **Add Landmark**: Put it on the plan, and apply the effects (updating the state).
3.  **Check Goal**: Make sure the plan leaves us in a state where the goal predicates are true.

Right, let's work through this. I can maintain a `state` variable that reflects the current state of the world, and apply each action, and make it true. The 'held\_block' variable is necessary.

Now I am ready to iterate through the given landmarks.
The `unstack` is usually first, and the `stack` actions will have to build the towers as a result of that. Let's trace it out and keep my plan organized:
```
(unstack b2 b20)  #...
(putdown b2)
(unstack b20 b27)
(putdown b20)
...
```

I can maintain a set of `clear` blocks and a set of `on` relations.
For `unstack`, the `held_block` needs to be `putdown` first. The effect on the clear and on predicates needs to be tracked.
For `stack`, just add it to the plan, and remove/add to/from the state. It needs to pick the block from the table, but that action will be automatically filled.
The goal check is simple; if I stack what I need in the right places, then the plan is valid, and the loop is done.

Great, with these details I can generate the PDDL plan.
