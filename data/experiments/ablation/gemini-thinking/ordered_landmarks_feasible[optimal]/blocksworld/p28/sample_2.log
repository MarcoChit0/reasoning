**Generating a PDDL Plan for Blocksworld**

Alright, let's craft a valid plan for this `blocksworld` instance, keeping in mind the provided domain, instance file, and the crucial action landmarks. My first step is a meticulous analysis of the initial and goal states. I'm focusing on those critical "on" and "clear" predicates that define the block arrangements, as well as the `arm-empty` condition, which dictates my ability to manipulate blocks.

The landmarks are the strategic compass here.  I recognize that a valid plan will involve a sequence of operations built around these key actions. My approach hinges on understanding the preconditions for each action, inserting auxiliary actions (`pickup`, `putdown`) to fulfill those prerequisites and maintain a consistent state.

I'll start by breaking down each landmark. I begin with `(unstack b16 b17)`. The initial state guarantees its precondition is met and that `b16` is on top of `b17`. This action changes the state such that I'm now holding `b16`, and `b17` is clear. To implement the other landmarks, I must "putdown" the blocks, so `arm-empty` is true. Subsequent unstack landmarks, and their putdown counterparts are applied, until all blocks that must be moved are on the table and clear. Then, I need to start stacking the blocks, by making sure `arm-empty` is true before picking up. I'll continue tracing through all the remaining landmarks.

The key to this problem seems to be an intricate dance of `pickup` and `putdown` actions to ensure the state reflects each landmark in the correct order. The sequence typically involves clearing blocks off the desired target, using `putdown` actions to create a clear area, `stack` actions will then apply.  The "clear" condition for a block is critical.

I've carefully considered the implications of each action on the state, including any required preconditions, particularly the state of the arm. My analysis of these landmarks and their associated state changes suggests the generation of valid actions.
I'll take the provided landmarks in a feasible order and make a final validation to ensure the produced plan achieves the goal state.
